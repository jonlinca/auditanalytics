A common request is to understand which vendor had the highest category of a charge (in this case, the `description`). Recall the `group_by()` will perform the calculation at the level requested. In this case, `slice_max()` will select the highest row of values by a variable.

```{r}
materials %>%
  group_by(vendor_id) %>%
  slice_max(amount, n = 2)
```
