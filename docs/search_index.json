["intro.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction", " Chapter 1 Introduction Within the accounting and audit profession, analytics has been around for several decades, under the concept of Computer Aided Auditing Techniques (CAATs). The software of choice was led by ACL and its ACL Analytics software. ACL Analytics was a significant audit enabler at the time, as it allowed direct access to analyze mainframe data and flat files that were otherwise inaccessible by mainstream software on the market. It enabled audit teams to obtain transparency in analysis, a rigorous audit trail, and even automation of scripts. As computers, data analytic technology and accessibility of coding in the Accounting practice has become mainstream, there are far more tools that enable auditors to become far more powerful and self sufficient than ever before. Tools that are typically reserved for software engineers and statisticians have empowered financial auditors to expand their breadth and scope. A traditional internal audit team would consider themselves to be consumers of information, limited by flat files sent by emails from their stakeholders. While most internal auditors have implemented data analytics in one way or another, the realm of possibilities and challenges have outpaced audit shop capabilities. The expectation now is for auditors to be fully integrated into the business, and contribute directly to the management of the financial and IT risks the company faces on a regular basis. The most effective way to meet this new standard is to implement a current data analytics architecture and empower your team to leverage modern data analytics techniques. "],
["approach.html", "Chapter 2 Approach 2.1 Code-based development 2.2 Automate relentlessly 2.3 Share everything 2.4 Always deliver useful product 2.5 Don’t be a hero 2.6 “The opportunity cost”", " Chapter 2 Approach For many audit teams, having data analytics employed in your audit team is generally a given. The advantages are well articulated - 100% population coverage, timely response, and targeted high risk identification and results are true and real. Unfortunately, any short-burst of investment in data analytics training tends to not last more than a few months. This is due to lack of applied skills, sustained management interest, and consistency of values. While regulations for adherence to SEC and Sox requirements exist and are necessary, the means to approaching and achieving compliance has been largely static in nature since the introduction of Sox. The root cause is that audit teams culturally view analytics as a skill, and not as a cultural shift. On a micro level, while not every individual on your audit team needs to be a ‘coder’, everyone needs to share the same values and philosophy for any audit analytics program to have success. Your core analytics team will set the foundation for the rest of the team to play on, but if they don’t show up, the analytics program is limited at best. Having a combination of the right values and technologies will enable your team to propel forward, and should amplify your teams efforts. By thoughtfully choosing your tools and encouraging sustainable processes, your team will create a positive cycle of development, learning and deployment. 2.1 Code-based development Consider the creation and auditing of a spreadsheet, where every row and column has the potential to be manipulated. Following the motto, ‘trust but verify’, an auditor would need to examine each cell value, the formulas, the relationships, and keep a sharp eye out for manual adjustments. The auditor also needs to validate the source of data in the spreadsheet. With no built-in tracability to how the spreadsheet is used after it has been created, it contributes to the madness that is the spreadsheet ecosystem. While it is easier to superficially consume information from a spreadsheet, to understand the inner workings is a tedious task into itself. And unfortunately, both controls and audits are conducted without a second thought within spreadsheets, as it is easier to tackle the task without fundamentally changing the approach itself. Contrast this to a code-based environment. To achieve anything in code, you need to be explicit and specific on the mechanisms taken to reach the end state. Each line will tell the program what inputs it needs, how it is processed, and the collection of lines tells you what is achieved. The beauty of this is that it also tells the reader exactly what was executed to achieve the end result. A code based environment is inherently self documenting. Once a baseline code has been established, finding ongoing changes becomes trivial. Similar to black-line functionality in Microsoft Word or Track Changes in Google Docs, its far easier to detect how code (and the process it supports) has changed. Perhaps with some merit, code can be difficult to read at times, as it is still a completely different language. Notebooks address this problem. Notebooks are interactive renderings of code, containing not only the code, but can also include sections of commentary as to why something was done, and can include data visualizations and interactivity. It is the ultimate form of auditability. 2.2 Automate relentlessly By writing your routines in code, then the next logical step is to automate. Automation not only frees up your time from performing a task, but it also frees up your mental critical thinking and creative processing power. Every professional has a cognitive load - don’t waste it on routine tasks. A common use case for automation in audit is the creation of a data mart that is relevant to auditors. A data mart is a collection of pre-processed data that is suited for the group using it - for example, a data mart may hold a daily refresh of HR information, or the prior month’s vendor invoices. Imagine that instead of needing to email HR for the latest employee list, the audit team merely needs to check within its internal database, making research and response quick and efficient. Instead of asking the vendor management team on how much money was spent per vendor, having this information in an audit mart already available means you can spend more time thinking about how to assess these vendors for risk. Gone are the days where you only audit a topic once a year. A byproduct of every audit is a monitoring mechanism - how do you know something has gone off the rails? Traditional remediation paths include a follow-up in the future - after that, there are few mechanisms to faithfully maintain confidence that the process is still operating reasonably. If you’ve coded your audit, then you have already done the hard work of structuring how to extract your data, finding exceptions and distributing actionable results for your stakeholders. Automation takes that one step further, and allows you to ensure the steps are done repeatedly. The value you derived initially from your audit can now be done continuously. Once you’ve audited the identification of issues and the metrics around them, then you can focus on the automation of work flow and resolution of them. With an audit controls database, you can upload the results of controls testing and issues identification into it, which will enable on-demand availability, visibility, transparency, and even reporting, all which can now be part of that larger automation process. 2.3 Share everything Tribal knowledge is information or knowledge that is known within a tribe but often unknown outside of it. A tribe, in this sense, may be a group or subgroup of people that share such a common knowledge. From a corporate perspective, “Tribal Knowledge or know-how is the collective wisdom of the organization. It is the sum of all the knowledge and capabilities of all the people”. (“Tribal Knowledge” 2020) When you code the procedures, not only are you creating letters to yourself in the future, but you’re also writing letters to everyone else on your team, even those who haven’t joined. These fully contained notebooks serve as a guide to those on your team who are learning what you have developed. The next thing to do is to put them in a central location where everyone on your team can access them. While you can opt for files and folders on a network drive, more practical technologies exist. Code repositories, such as git and subversion, serve a purpose in your data analytics environment to track changes to code and notebooks. You can encourage your team to upload notebooks to these repositories to access the latest and greatest code that your team has developed for problems already solved. New team members can go into a repository to learn how code has solved prior problems, and become inspired to solve problems of their own. As your team gains more experience and consistency, it may be more practical to write repeatable processes and functions instead of copy and pasting code between notebooks. Code packages enable you to share your code and functions to solve specific problems, templates to encourage consistency amongst team members, and are easily distributed to your team for quick deployment. 2.4 Always deliver useful product The outputs of your work are useless if they are not adopted by the business. This means you need to prioritize your customer and iterate often, to win buy-in, gain momentum and stay on course. Audit teams are always surprised when I say that they have customers. Audit department interactions are across the entire company and up-and-down the entire chain - from manufacturing to engineering, IT to accounting, analysts to the c-suite. Audit departments handle all these groups, with kid-gloves and diplomacy. Yet we tend to ignore the #1 customer - ourselves. Audit teams are usually at the mercy of what the business deems most convenient for them - whether in terms of reports, testing controls or even where files are kept. Historically, this was tolerated. Audit teams were composed of accountants that specialized in Excel, IT auditors in testing general controls, and a focus adhering to evolving accounting standards. With the advance in maturity of code-based tools and even commercial audit software, there has been never a better time to code intuition. The idea of these data products is that they promote the cognitive ease - this means, repeated experience, clear display, primed idea, and good mood.(Kahneman 2011) By helping your team feel at ease, but they should deliver both the most trivial of tasks and the most time-consuming tests of applied knowledge. By removing the need to execute these tasks, then the customer can focus on what they’re good at - in the case of auditors, its applying professional judgement. These products can be taken up in the form of data generation, data and trend visualization, or standardize reporting. 2.5 Don’t be a hero Not everything needs to be fixed by you, especially in code. In a well-functioning organization where hundreds of people are supporting different software, application or databases, sometimes the best way to solve the problems found isn’t directly in the work you do, but how you get others to fix systemic issues in the source itself. Key indicators of this are when you have to start hard-coding compensating controls in your code because the upstream data isn’t standardized. For example, in a typical company, employees are issued unique ID numbers. This is preferably at the source of truth - the Human Resources department. This identifier is generally considered reliable and stable, especially if is the source of truth. Consider now that you’re now trying to join the data to a credit card system, where employees are issued credit cards based on their first and last name. If you take an assumption to join this dataset using an individuals first and last name, that would be a reasonable first attempt. However, last names can change over time, or individuals may prefer to go with their middle names, or even simple spelling mistakes can occur. Instead of compensating by adding different ways of ‘joining’ information, its more effective to work with the application’s data owner to see if they would be willing to adopt the unique employee ID instead as a field in their system. 2.6 “The opportunity cost” The idea of opportunity costs presumes the fungibility of human experience: all our activities are equivalent or interchangeable once they are reduced to the abstract currency of clock time, and its wage correlate. (Crawford 2009) An internal auditors’ largest limitation is time. The biggest barrier to the adoption and execution of data analytic talents is the fact there is ‘more’ perceived value in doing something else. A common excuse is that a task will only be performed once (or even worse, at an irregular basis) - auditors may instead opt to perform a manual task in an unsustainable way. Instead of learning a new skill, our opportunity cost is projected against how much time can be used have to perform this task at hand. If your existence was highly limited by the lifespan of a fly, it would be hard to argue against such a position. However, your career is long (hopefully), fruitful and full of exciting and interesting work. Truly engaging work should challenging and rewarding, and applying coding to audit lends itself to a skill worth mastering. Using these skills, no matter how immature, will continue to pay off dividends in future implementations, no matter how insignificant or incremental. Implementing repeatable processes means not only does the end consumer receive their product quicker, but the data auditor is enabled to continuously refine or tackle another code-related problem. And that is worth the opportunity cost, today. References "],
["architecture.html", "Chapter 3 Architecture 3.1 R and RStudio 3.2 Code repositories 3.3 Data products 3.4 Data sources 3.5 Audit data mart", " Chapter 3 Architecture Figure 3.1: Internal Audit Data Analytics Architecture The architecture and tools you select should support and amplify your team, and not be a burden to maintain. Maintenance of databases and applications can also be delegated to application support teams, so you can focus on implementing analytics and delivering data products. Other things to consider: You should have, at a bare minimum, direct access to read-only internal databases or data warehouses. A generic service user account has its merits here when it comes to automation - tying an eventual automation to a user with password expiry every 90 days will make updating passwords feel like quarterly financial reporting. Any software you consider should be able to talk to your company’s internal and external applications. Be wary of software that locks you in or makes access to data cumbersome, as it limits your ability to integrate with your company’s tools as you gain sophistication. 3.1 R and RStudio R is a programming language with an emphasis on statistics. It is considered free software, free in the perspective that you can run, distribute, and change it as you like. What makes R so great is the large suite of packages that are available to use to help analyze information. What doesn’t exist in base R will likely have been developed by someone else: there are hundreds of packages that support data connectivity (DBI, xlsx), day-to-day manipulation and analysis (dplyr, ggplot2), and even auditing (jfa, MUS). CRAN is the central repository for all these packages that meet minimum quality standards. As R is a language, you may want to consider an application to code in, similar to how you may write memos in Microsoft Word. RStudio Desktop is an integrated development environment (IDE) that has an open source version and is free to use. There are also free versions of RStudio Server, as well as commercially supported versions of its Desktop, Server, and two unique products that we will go into more later - Package Manager and Connect. With both R and RStudio installed, you can perform the minimum requirements of your audit data analysis career: you can download data, wrangle it, visualize it, and save completed analyses. The potential is limitless though, as it enables all the other technologies to operate with it - machine learning, automation, dashboarding, and code sharing. 3.2 Code repositories Here is a typical logistical challenge faced in even the smallest of audit teams. Person A will write the first version of a script to download data (V1). Person B in the team may want to use it to download data from elsewhere, so they will get an emailed script file from person B, modify it, and start to use it. Person A may make improvements to their own file (now V2), but Person B will not benefit from the improvements. Knowledge are immediately siloed, and changes become more difficult to share between auditors. One of the most effective ways to solve this problem is to leverage a code repository (also known as version control). While version control has several software engineering advantages, the most notable advantages for audit teams are: Centralizing domain knowledge and sharing code, Tracking and tracing changes to code throughout time (including who, what was changed, and when), and Ability to test with an isolated code set before rolling out to production. Code versioning technologies resonate closely with IT General Controls and even the COBIT framework. 3.2.1 git git is a type of version control. Another free, open source software, and the basic usage of the tool is accessible. The basics of git are: Pull code from the remote server to the local computer. Write and save code on your local computer. Commit code on your local computer. Push code from your local computer to the remote server. While this is a superficial example of how to use git, it is enough to get the most basic of audit teams started. The git hole can go very deep, so if things don’t go according to plan, just remember that you can always make a new folder and start fresh. Several different server technologies support git - GitHub, Azure Repos within Azure DevOps, gitlab are all willing to host your code. If you’re using these to hold proprietary or sensitive code, it would be wise to get your company’s support and pay for the ability to have a private repository that only your team can see. 3.2.2 Packages As you write more code and templates, you will eventually want to share these new techniques with others on your team. Packages put your best practices together, including templates, functions to solve common problems, and templates for common workflows. In short: packages contain tasks help you do your job, and save you time. Packages go beyond the tangible and provide several qualitative benefits as well. They standardize your team’s workflow, create consistency and readability standards, and get your team to speak a single language. It creates a cohesive foundation where anyone on the team can contribute, and a library for those who wish to learn more. How do you share packages? You certainly don’t not need to force your team to copy-and-paste code or even a templates from a central folder! The most elegant way to distribute your code is via hosting packages on a code or package repository. These repositories (hosted internally or externally) enable your team to download best practices with a simple line of code. You can also compile your packages and leave them on a network drive. The best part? You can give your package a creative name that represents the culture of your internal audit team or organization. Just don’t call it auditR. 3.3 Data products All auditors face this problem at one point or another. An audit finding doesn’t matter until someone takes accountability for it. And if an audit finding is too vague, or does not have the buy-in from the right stakeholders, it is as good as unsolicited advice. The data analysis you deliver are vulnerable to the same expectations. Not only do they need to be objective and accurate, but they also need to be accessible, relevant, and delivered at the right time. If there are too many barriers for entry or usage, someone will revert back to their old processes and methods. Here is a sobering thought: when was the last time you made a beautiful visualization for someone, only to be asked for the detailed Excel worksheet afterwards? Or instead of an automated report that users can self-serve, someone asks for an email instead? Data products are deliverable that enhance your customer’s ability to gather, process and analyze information. They facilitate decision making and are integrated into their processes. They should be designed thoughtfully and simply, masking the complexity underneath. In short, they should make your co-auditors feel like rockstars. The reports you write and code you develop should strive for the goal of being accessible by your team, on-time and on-demand. 3.3.1 Galvanize Highbond Galvanize, the parent company of ACL Analytics and one of the most popular companies in the audit software industry, invested significant efforts into their cloud-based working paper solution, Highbond. One of their modules, Highbond Results, is an unrivaled for audit exception and remediation workflow. The idea with an audit exception workflow is that audit testing will identify an actionable transaction or outcome. This may be an exception within a process, a control requiring execution, or even a request for additional information or clarification. Once a process has been designed, Highbond Results will allow you to focus on the users who should action the workflow and the rules for setting up triggers. While Galvanize is a separate, third-party product that is not directly in the R universe, it does integrate with R through its API. The API enables you to upload findings and results directly into a Results set, allowing you to create the workflows on the website. The API also enables access to its Projects data that your audit team may already use to document audits, offering advantages to audit teams that design their workpaper environments effectively. Highbond Results also provides capabilities to do no-code based visualizations hosted on the web. Once set up, they offer a stable method of delivering storyboards and visualizations. Galvanize cloud-based tools are fully hosted, meaning audit teams pay for high availability and security maintained by a professional team. Galvanize supports the security, design and coding for hosting a tool online, allowing you to focus on designing workflows for your internal customers. 3.3.2 RStudio Connect RStudio PBC, which became a Certified B Corporation in 2020, offers the RStudio Connect solution that allows R deliverable to be hosted online. These include: RMarkdown notebooks, which are fully self-contained analytics. These notebooks perform full analyses from start to finish, including downloading data, wrangling, analysis and data visualization. These notebooks can also act at Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) processes. These notebooks have the advantage of being automatically scheduled, with rules that can notify stakeholders if need be. The loading component can be any destination - most popular is the audit data mart, or into other web applications via API connectivity (example: Galvanize Highbond Results). The hosting of Shiny apps, which are interactive web applications, offer a way to analyze and present information in an intelligent, slick manner. The analysis performed in R can be factored into a Shiny app, which can be hooked directly into your data. For audit teams with expertise in programming, RStudio Connect offers some of the best capabilities for publishing visualizations and analysis to your teams and internal stakeholders. With its git capability, it can also receive updates from a code repository, integrating tightly with a team’s best practices of a code repository. RStudio server software will require talent and cost to stand-up and maintain, and should be considered in an environment where automation and internal hosting of data products will bring advantages to an internal audit team. Lightweight alternatives include the hosting a free Shiny Server or low-cost publishing to Shinyapps.io. 3.3.3 RStudio Package Manager As your team develops more code and functions, there becomes a greater need to distribute these best practices easily. RStudio Package Manager offers the capability to distribute code packages to your coworkers and even the broader organization. By integrating with your code repository, it can bundle new functionality added by your team and distribute it. It offers versioning of packages, for those audit environments where reproducability is paramount. An alternative is also miniCRAN, a reduced feature set yet free and open source version, or even simply hosting packages on a network drive. 3.4 Data sources The end goal of automation ETLs, and creating and hosting data products for audit customers to consume. To achieve these goals, an audit team needs direct, programmatic access to the data being audited. By programmatic, we mean that code can be used to access data, versus going through a front-end user interface. 3.4.1 Internal databases At its core, databases hold transactional information that runs the business. Databases generally can fit two separate use cases: Online Transaction Processing (OLTP), for high speed transaction writing, and Online Analytic Processing (OLAP), for analyzing to support business decisions. Typically OLTP databases act as a source of truth, and send updates to the OLAP database. The language of choice to access internal databases is Structured Query Language (SQL). As a defacto standard for accessing databases since 1970’s, all relational databases still leverage SQL. While each brand may have subtle nuances in the way SQL works, this essential language will allow your audit team to access a majority of sources within the company. Non-relational databases and NoSQL are becoming more mainstream, as well as graph databases, so your audit team will need to tool up as necessary. Audit teams historically had a bad reputation for ‘bringing down the database’. While this used to be quite common, nowadays computing power is so accessible and cheap that the fear is generally unwarranted. Great caution should still be taken, where you should avoid querying any production database that supports customers or staff directly, unless absolutely necessary. Other strategies are useful depending on the circumstances: Filter the data with WHERE clauses, Perform joins in the database, instead of downloading multiple tables individually and joining them on the desktop, Download data in chunks or segments, split by day, week or month, or Schedule queries during off-business hours. 3.4.2 External sources As more applications move to the cloud, using SQL to access data becomes more difficult. While some of this data can be brought into an internal data warehouse or used as an integration, more often than not transactional data is left online within the tool. Certain online cloud software providers will make an Application Programming Interface (API) available for customers These APIs open a window to the cloud application, where subsets of data can be downloaded from the system. Each vendor may provide API documentation, and then can be accessed via packages like httr and digested with jsonlite. While APIs enable audit teams to retrieve data, it adds a layer of difficulty in obtaining data: Each API behaves differently - authentication, calls, and the data return all may vary between systems. APIs endpoints, the part that allows a tool to query it, tend to be highly specific-use cases, and may provide a limited scope of data at one time. Data may not be in the format that you want, or even exist - you are at the mercy what the API supplies. If an API does allow for a larger data download, it may be limited by pagnation, where multiple results are spread out over multiple pages. APIs may be ‘rate-limited’, which means it may restrict the number of queries, whether in parallel or in sequence. Tips for audit teams needing to rely on cloud providers: API access should be part of the requirements before signing an agreement with a provider. Ask for, and generate, an API key for usage, and treat it like a password. If APIs are out of the skill of your team, consider asking your IT department to schedule a data pull into your audit data mart. 3.5 Audit data mart While internal databases are accessible, generally they hold the entirety of the company’s data, which is far too much information. Only a fraction of the data is considered important and significant to the audit team. An audit data mart is a key piece of infrastructure that will sit between your data products and data source. This data mart should contain highly specific, refined and cleaned data, which improves the speed and responsiveness of data products and data-on-demand. The audit data mart can also be secured to your audit team members, so confidentiality is not compromised. To take full advantage of an audit data mart, an automated ETL process should connect directly to internal databases, and perform transformations to get to a clean end product. ETLs can be created and scheduled within RStudio Connect. "],

["import-data.html", "Chapter 5 Import data 5.1 Delimited files 5.2 Databases 5.3 APIs", " Chapter 5 Import data In this chapter, we will download some datasets and import them. You will need the following packages to follow along. library(dplyr) # For manipulating data library(readr) # For reading flat files library(DBI) # For database connections # For API connections library(httr) library(jsonlite) 5.1 Delimited files The most common method of obtaining data is via flat files, usually in the form of comma separated files (CSV). While delimited data sources are the most convenient for data sources where direct data connections are otherwise unobtainable, they are not set up for long term sustainability and automation. The base package, installed with all instances of R, and read.table() is a convenient built-in standard function for importing CSV files. Another package, readr, includes a similar function called read_delim(), which is faster and allows for easy altering of column specifications, which directs the data types each column is imported as (for example, overriding an employee’s identification number as a character versus an numeric). Before importing the file, lets download the file from the repository that contains the Vendor Master. This dataset contains the vendor system ID number, the date it was added, and other traits. dir.create(&quot;data&quot;, showWarnings = FALSE) # Creates a directory in your project download.file(url = &quot;https://github.com/jonlinca/auditanalytics/raw/master/data/vendor_master.csv&quot;, destfile = &quot;data/vendor_master.csv&quot;, mode = &quot;wb&quot;) # Downloads this csv file into the data folder When importing delimited files, there will always be a few aspects to consider. The delimiter is the character that separates each field - while commas (,) are popular, pipes (|) and tabs are also used as they tend to be less common. Using an uncommon character was a typical workaround when exporting data from legacy systems, as commas within text fields were incorrectly parsed as extra columns. If possible, qualifiers should used to enclose text with a field, typically quotes or double quotes. This will indicate to the system that everything within those quotes belongs to a specific field. In this case, if you view the file (on the Files panel on the right, go to the data folder, click on vendor_master.csv, and select View File), you will see the data is separated by commas. raw_vendors &lt;- read_delim(&#39;data/vendor_master.csv&#39;, delim = &quot;,&quot;) ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## id = col_double(), ## type = col_character(), ## name = col_character(), ## date_added = col_date(format = &quot;&quot;), ## summary = col_character(), ## `2015` = col_double(), ## `2016` = col_double(), ## `2017` = col_double(), ## `2018` = col_double() ## ) The message indicates that default column types were assigned to each field imported. If it all the fields imported as expected, this message can be ignored. However, ID numbers, while presented as a number, don’t have a real value in any calculations. As a result, you can specify a column specification via the col_types argument, copy and pasting the framework in the message and changing the fields as need be: cols &lt;- cols( id = col_character(), # Changed from col_double() name = col_character(), date_added = col_date(format = &quot;&quot;), `2015` = col_double(), `2016` = col_double(), `2017` = col_double(), `2018` = col_double() ) raw_vendors &lt;- read_delim(&#39;data/vendor_master.csv&#39;, delim = &quot;,&quot;, col_types = cols) glimpse(raw_vendors) ## Rows: 9 ## Columns: 9 ## $ id &lt;chr&gt; &quot;793&quot;, &quot;666&quot;, &quot;77&quot;, &quot;2726&quot;, &quot;2612&quot;, &quot;2211&quot;, &quot;2726&quot;, &quot;2612&quot;… ## $ type &lt;chr&gt; &quot;E&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;V&quot; ## $ name &lt;chr&gt; &quot;al-Bangura, Habeeba&quot;, &quot;Akina, Duncan&quot;, &quot;el-Kazmi, Muneefa… ## $ date_added &lt;date&gt; 2015-07-15, 2015-07-28, 2015-05-26, 2015-05-23, 2015-07-0… ## $ summary &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, &quot;spend&quot;, &quot;spend&quot;, &quot;spend&quot;, &quot;credits&quot;, &quot;credits… ## $ `2015` &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, 65325.5287, 88270.0937, 51847.2728, 509.4308, … ## $ `2016` &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, 83413.7426, 148569.7780, 89260.3035, 860.3997,… ## $ `2017` &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, 150261.9517, 254178.2672, 142074.7898, 908.947… ## $ `2018` &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, 55569.8474, 179056.0944, 76761.0587, 347.9129,… You may have noticed that while our normal columns are specified as-is, we had to wrap our years with backticks (`), because while a column can technically be a number, asking R to reference a number will interpret it as a value, and not a field name. 5.1.1 Handling problematic delimited files While well exported delimited files can be useful, they often contain hidden surprises. Consider this rather innocuous csv file from active directory (the controller for Windows authentication), with a username and manager fields: # Active directory file, with just a username and manager field. download.file(url = &quot;https://github.com/jonlinca/auditanalytics/raw/master/data/active_directory.csv&quot;, destfile = &quot;data/active_directory.csv&quot;, mode = &quot;wb&quot;) # Downloads this csv file into the data folder raw_ad &lt;- read_delim(&#39;data/active_directory.csv&#39;, delim = &quot;;&quot;) ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## uid = col_character(), ## manager = col_character() ## ) ## Warning: 2 parsing failures. ## row col expected actual file ## 2 -- 2 columns 1 columns &#39;data/active_directory.csv&#39; ## 4 -- 2 columns 1 columns &#39;data/active_directory.csv&#39; These warnings indicate that there were columns expected (as dictated by the first line of column headers), but missing in one or more lines. You can inspect the csv file in the RStudio interface by clicking on the file on the navigation pane to the right, and select ‘View File’. You will notice that the location for both accounts is on a new line, but it belongs to the prior record. The raw characters can be confirmed within R, by reading the file directly as is (i.e. raw): ad_char &lt;- readChar(&#39;data/active_directory.csv&#39;, file.info(&#39;data/active_directory.csv&#39;)$size) print(ad_char) ## [1] &quot;uid;manager\\r\\njonlin; jason durrand\\nlocation: calgary\\r\\nronaldlee; reid turra\\nlocation: melbourne&quot; These special characters are hidden within the seemingly innocuous delimited file, and are typical of systems where information is extracted from, especially Windows, \\r represents a carriage return, and \\n represents a line feed. Together, \\r\\n represents a new line and new record, while \\n can appear in a file when a new line is made by pressing Shift+Enter. In this common yet inconvenient case, these can be substituted out with regular expressions. Regular expressions are a standard, cryptic yet powerful way to match text in strings. We will cover specific use cases of these in Searching Text. In this case, the below regular expression only replaces \\n when there is no \\r preceding it. The gsub() function will try to match the regular expression criteria in the in the first field, with its replacement value in the second field. gsub(&quot;(?&lt;!\\\\r)\\\\n&quot;,&quot; &quot;, ad_char, perl = TRUE) ## [1] &quot;uid;manager\\r\\njonlin; jason durrand location: calgary\\r\\nronaldlee; reid turra location: melbourne&quot; The gsub output shows that the manager’s name and location no longer has a \\n in between them. As a result, it can now be imported cleanly. ad_raw &lt;- read_delim(gsub(&quot;(?&lt;!\\\\r)\\\\n&quot;,&quot; &quot;, ad_char, perl = TRUE), delim = &quot;;&quot;) print(ad_raw) ## # A tibble: 2 x 2 ## uid manager ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 jonlin &quot; jason durrand location: calgary&quot; ## 2 ronaldlee &quot; reid turra location: melbourne&quot; 5.2 Databases It is likely that the company you are auditing will have their data stored in a database. While having skills in SQL is recommended, having R skills means you are able to perform basic queries on databases. There are many different database brands and vendors in the world, and thus there are many different subtleties on how SQL works for each vendor, but they mostly adhere to the same principles,. The Open Databases Connectivity (ODBC) standard allows different vendors to write drivers, or the technical back-end methods, to connect to their database. Generally, you will need a driver that matches the vendor and version of the database you’re using. Installing a driver is straight forward The Database Interface (DBI) is the interaction between R and the driver. Practically speaking, it enables R to send queries to the database via the driver that is defined in the ODBC. The most common way to connect to a database on your network is to install the vendor drivers, and then create a Data Source Name (DSN). To properly create this DSN, you’ll need the name of your database, as well as read-only credentials. Alternatively, you may specify the server name, database schema and credentials explicitly, which offers some advantages from a portability perspective as your other team mates will not need to create DSNs, and only need to install the drivers themselves. For this example, we will use an SQLite database, which are self sustained databases files and perfect for lightweight applications (including training!) Again, lets start by downloading the file, or in this case, a database: dir.create(&quot;data&quot;, showWarnings = FALSE) download.file(url = &quot;https://github.com/jonlinca/auditanalytics/raw/master/data/rauditanalytics.sqlite&quot;, destfile = &quot;data/rauditanalytics.sqlite&quot;, mode = &quot;wb&quot;) One thing that is different about connecting to databases is that you need to set up a database connection within R. This will usually consist of a driver (in this case, RSQLite::SQLite()), a DSN or a file location (data/rauditanalytics.sqlite). In the help file, it asks for other needed fields as well; user, password, host etc. At your company, having that information along with ports, schema names, and whether or not its a trusted connection (authenticating automatically with your own active directory credentials). If you haven’t yet already at your company, request a read-only account that can get this information. We’re going to establish a connection with the database, creating the con connection object: con &lt;- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), &quot;data/rauditanalytics.sqlite&quot;) You can confirm it works by listing the tables in the database. One important thing to remember is that you’ll be passing this connection object each time as you perform your commands. For example, if you want to see what tables exist in the database and schema, you will still need to tell the command which database you want to connect to. dbListTables(con) ## [1] &quot;gl&quot; &quot;industry&quot; &quot;tb&quot; &quot;vendors&quot; Typically to get data out of a database, you’ll need to communicate to it in its own language to obtain data - SQL (Structured Query Language). Here is an example of how to select all the records in a table: dbGetQuery(con, &#39;select * from gl&#39;) ## je_num amount gl_date gl_date_char vendor_id account ## 1 1 22667.46 18232 2019-12-02 2211 exp_materials_6000 ## invoice_date description paid_date ## 1 18225 Packaging and boxes 18262 ## [ reached &#39;max&#39; / getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) -- omitted 1999 rows ] While knowing SQL is advantageous (and eventually critical), sometimes switching between languages is a hassle, especially when performing basic tasks within a database. Using the dplyr package, you can generate several of the same queries using the dplyr syntax. All you need to do is create a reference to the table in the connection object - in this case, the con connection object contains the gl table: db_gl &lt;- tbl(con, &#39;gl&#39;) db_gl ## # Source: table&lt;gl&gt; [?? x 9] ## # Database: sqlite 3.30.1 ## # [/Users/jon/Documents/R/auditanalytics/data/rauditanalytics.sqlite] ## je_num amount gl_date gl_date_char vendor_id account invoice_date ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 22667. 18232 2019-12-02 2211 exp_ma… 18225 ## 2 1 -22667. 18232 2019-12-02 NA liab_a… 18225 ## 3 2 1397. 18228 2019-11-28 2612 exp_ma… 18218 ## 4 2 -1397. 18228 2019-11-28 NA liab_a… 18218 ## 5 3 2319. 17995 2019-04-09 2612 exp_ma… 17985 ## 6 3 -2319. 17995 2019-04-09 NA liab_a… 17985 ## 7 4 20037. 18199 2019-10-30 2612 exp_ma… 18189 ## 8 4 -20037. 18199 2019-10-30 NA liab_a… 18189 ## 9 5 43140. 18051 2019-06-04 2612 exp_ma… 18041 ## 10 5 -43140. 18051 2019-06-04 NA liab_a… 18041 ## # … with more rows, and 2 more variables: description &lt;chr&gt;, paid_date &lt;dbl&gt; Not only is it pointing to the same table, but its also performing the same query: db_gl %&gt;% show_query() ## &lt;SQL&gt; ## SELECT * ## FROM `gl` There are a few differences though between using these approaches. dbGetQuery() will return a data.frame that is immediately usable, while creating the table connection via tbl() results in a preview of the query but hasn’t been formally downloaded in the database. In order to use the data within R with tbl(), a further collect() is needed. Instead of performing a data download every time, it is advantageous to preview the results first before collecting it. dbGetQuery requires the entire SQL query to be pre-written, and can not be further leveraged within the database. However, the tbl object can still be further manipulated. This is especially useful when creating new fields or performing joins in same database. Lets say that you wanted to filter amounts greater than $75,000 in the database. In the SQL method, you would need to type a whole new SQL query: dbGetQuery(con, &#39;select * from gl where amount &gt; 75000&#39;) ## je_num amount gl_date gl_date_char vendor_id account ## 1 140 96354.61 18249 2019-12-19 2211 exp_materials_6000 ## invoice_date description paid_date ## 1 18242 Packaging and boxes 18279 ## [ reached &#39;max&#39; / getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) -- omitted 1 rows ] Where in the dplyr method, you would only need to build on the same connection object already established. Identical queries, and results db_gl_threshold &lt;- db_gl %&gt;% dplyr::filter(amount &gt; 75000) db_gl_threshold ## # Source: lazy query [?? x 9] ## # Database: sqlite 3.30.1 ## # [/Users/jon/Documents/R/auditanalytics/data/rauditanalytics.sqlite] ## je_num amount gl_date gl_date_char vendor_id account invoice_date description ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 140 96355. 18249 2019-12-19 2211 exp_ma… 18242 Packaging … ## 2 693 88524. 18121 2019-08-13 2726 exp_ma… 18114 Quality co… ## # … with 1 more variable: paid_date &lt;dbl&gt; show_query(db_gl_threshold) ## &lt;SQL&gt; ## SELECT * ## FROM `gl` ## WHERE (`amount` &gt; 75000.0) And when you’re happy with this, simply collect() to save the query results as a data frame. To be nice to your database administrators, you should also disconnect from the database to free up a connection. gl_threshold &lt;- db_gl_threshold %&gt;% collect() dbDisconnect(con) We will go through an advanced application of setting up database queries in Audit Package Creation, which builds upon leveraging dplyr to create the pieces that enable powerful queries. 5.3 APIs As more applications are hosted on the cloud, it is an important skill to obtain information from them without resorting to manually triggered reports. Data can be accessed from these systems via a Application Programming Interface (API), and typically it is exposed via the method Representational State Transfer (REST). An API will allow one application to talk to another. Some examples of APIs are web sites with search functions, or loading a list of comments other users have published, or determining who is friends with whom. REST advises how the endpoint is structured, and also suggests how the data is returned. While APIs may be more complicated, the end objective is to obtain data is quite straight forward. A user needs to know what they want, then: match what is desired to the ‘endpoint’, a pre-defined url or path where the data resides, send a valid request to GET the data, and receive the response. Here is an oversimplistic example. Lets say you want to see what repositories I have available to the public. You can list the repositories I have through the github api via the httr package and the GET command. For anything sensitive, it will likely be protected and require authentication as well. library(httr) library(jsonlite) response &lt;- GET(&#39;https://api.github.com/users/jonlinca/repos&#39;) response ## Response [https://api.github.com/users/jonlinca/repos] ## Date: 2020-08-27 22:06 ## Status: 200 ## Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8 ## Size: 28.7 kB ## [ ## { ## &quot;id&quot;: 129155075, ## &quot;node_id&quot;: &quot;MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjkxNTUwNzU=&quot;, ## &quot;name&quot;: &quot;ACLandR_DeployingModels&quot;, ## &quot;full_name&quot;: &quot;jonlinca/ACLandR_DeployingModels&quot;, ## &quot;private&quot;: false, ## &quot;owner&quot;: { ## &quot;login&quot;: &quot;jonlinca&quot;, ## &quot;id&quot;: 29468012, ## ... The structure of the data in an API looks different than a data frame. Typically there is an overall response (indicating success or the nature of the failure), the type of content (in this case, ‘application/json’), and the data itself. The entire download is usually stored as a list with multiple references: names(response) ## [1] &quot;url&quot; &quot;status_code&quot; &quot;headers&quot; &quot;all_headers&quot; &quot;cookies&quot; ## [6] &quot;content&quot; &quot;date&quot; &quot;times&quot; &quot;request&quot; &quot;handle&quot; And the data you want will be in the response’s $content: head(response$content) ## [1] 5b 0a 20 20 7b 0a This raw data is generally uninterpretable, and it is because the structure of the data is in a different format - in this case, the Content-Type above indicates it is a json file. Its quite easy to convert the data in this format to something more understandable with the httr content() and jsonlite fromJSON() and toJSON() functions: content &lt;- content(response) cleancontent &lt;- jsonlite::fromJSON(jsonlite::toJSON(content), flatten = TRUE) # Print it out cleancontent[,c(&#39;id&#39;, &#39;name&#39;)] ## id name ## 1 129155075 ACLandR_DeployingModels ## 2 164948874 ACLandR_KMeans ## 3 269707027 auditanalytics ## 4 183726578 calgaryr ## 5 277917653 galvanizer Some data sources may be difficult to obtain data from, or perhaps you’re not quite ready at the technical skill level to develop your own data connectivity for APIs. One alternative for such information is the use of a third party tool - for example, CData supports an interface that allows you to interact with programs like Office 365 (including emails and file audit logs) directly. Office 365 also offers APIs that expose Sharepoint and Outlook, although they take more time to understand. "],
["data-completeness.html", "Chapter 6 Data Completeness 6.1 Exploration of General Ledger data 6.2 Examination of potential errors 6.3 Transforming of Trial Balance data 6.4 Asserting Completeness 6.5 Cautionary notes for Completeness", " Chapter 6 Data Completeness The first thing you should do when you get a new piece of data, before you do any analysis, is to validate the data for obvious data errors and to perform completeness testing. The intent of Completeness testing is to evaluate whether you have received a full set of data - data anomalies can be explored further after the preliminary testing (for example, malformed dates, NA information, etc.). Ideally, completeness on a data set should be performed by comparing to another data set - for example, a detailed ledger can roll up into account balances. Other ways of performing completeness is to compare data against a third party, independently managed source of information. For this section we will use the accounting database and validate our Journal Entry file prior to doing further work. We covered the importing of data in the prior chapter, so we’ll do that again along with some packages: library(dplyr) # For manipulating data library(tidyr) # For making data long and wide library(DBI) # For database connections dir.create(&quot;data&quot;, showWarnings = FALSE) download.file(url = &quot;https://github.com/jonlinca/auditanalytics/raw/master/data/rauditanalytics.sqlite&quot;, destfile = &quot;data/rauditanalytics.sqlite&quot;, mode = &quot;wb&quot;) con &lt;- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), &quot;data/rauditanalytics.sqlite&quot;) # Creates a table reference and collects the table, saving it as a gl object gl &lt;- tbl(con, &#39;gl&#39;) %&gt;% collect() 6.1 Exploration of General Ledger data General Ledger (GL) data is where all the transactions against the accounting system are stored. Sub-ledgers may exist for specific systems (Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, Inventory) in a more detailed form, and these systems will also post to the General Ledger. For the data set in our example, we’ve requested and received a full year’s worth of transactions. A rapid preview of all your columns can be done quickly with summary(). Not only does it list all the fields available in the table, but it also gives quick statistics on numeric columns as well (whether it makes sense is up to you): summary(gl) ## je_num amount gl_date gl_date_char ## Min. : 1.0 Min. :-96355 Min. :17897 Length:2000 ## 1st Qu.: 250.8 1st Qu.: -6846 1st Qu.:17986 Class :character ## Median : 500.5 Median : 0 Median :18080 Mode :character ## Mean : 500.5 Mean : 0 Mean :18078 ## 3rd Qu.: 750.2 3rd Qu.: 6846 3rd Qu.:18171 ## Max. :1000.0 Max. : 96355 Max. :18261 ## ## vendor_id account invoice_date description ## Min. : 77 Length:2000 Min. :17887 Length:2000 ## 1st Qu.:2211 Class :character 1st Qu.:17976 Class :character ## Median :2612 Mode :character Median :18072 Mode :character ## Mean :2464 Mean :18069 ## 3rd Qu.:2726 3rd Qu.:18162 ## Max. :2726 Max. :18254 ## NA&#39;s :1000 NA&#39;s :44 ## paid_date ## Min. :17900 ## 1st Qu.:18003 ## Median :18097 ## Mean :18096 ## 3rd Qu.:18188 ## Max. :18291 ## NA&#39;s :44 A high level summary scan is useful for us: je_num is a number value, although it has no meaning as a number, as it is a reference. vendor_id is a number as well, but it contains NA’s. NA’s are R’s way of indicating that data does not exist. amount is both positive and negative - indicating this column has indicators of both credits and debits The dates (gl_date, invoice_date and paid_date) are numeric while gl_date_char is a character. We will talk about converting these dates to something interpretable in the next chapter. It may be useful to look at a few data samples more closely to understand patterns. head() is useful in seeing the first few columns head(gl) ## # A tibble: 6 x 9 ## je_num amount gl_date gl_date_char vendor_id account invoice_date description ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 22667. 18232 2019-12-02 2211 exp_ma… 18225 Packaging … ## 2 1 -22667. 18232 2019-12-02 NA liab_a… 18225 Packaging … ## 3 2 1397. 18228 2019-11-28 2612 exp_ma… 18218 Paper ## 4 2 -1397. 18228 2019-11-28 NA liab_a… 18218 Paper ## 5 3 2319. 17995 2019-04-09 2612 exp_ma… 17985 Paper ## 6 3 -2319. 17995 2019-04-09 NA liab_a… 17985 Paper ## # … with 1 more variable: paid_date &lt;dbl&gt; We get a more detailed understanding of the fields: je_num indicates a set of lines within a journal entry. vendor_id is usually associated to an expense account. amount is both positive and negative for the same journal entry - this means theoretically, it should balance to zero. The dates, gl_date specifically, are numeric while gl_date_char appears as a date (but is still a character). 6.2 Examination of potential errors 6.2.1 NA values At this stage, you could explore obvious potential issues - in this case, NA values have surfaced themselves early through the summary() command, so we should explore it a bit. NAs are “Not available” or Missing Values. As an auditor, its important for to understand why NA values exist in your data set. Reasons I have heard in my career include: Data was not recorded - A field may be blank because it was intentionally or accidentally omitted. A “void date” is quite commonly NA in a GL database as most entries have not been voided. Or perhaps a journal entry is NA because it has not yet been approved. There may be business rules that indicate why a row’s value may be NA. Data was not recorded at the time - A data source is always evolving, and new columns may be introduced as new features are rolled out or data structure changes. For example, a relatively new requirement indicating companies must identify government companies within their databases, and only applicable for new companies in the database. Vendors entered prior to this change may be left as NA. Inappropriate coercion - the column type was converted from one to another and a loss of value occured. For example, converting the letter ‘a’ using as.numeric() will give the following: as.numeric(&#39;a&#39;) ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion ## [1] NA Its not that this value never existed. The letter ‘a’ did exist in the original format, but it doesn’t have a numerical representation within R. As it did not have a valid value when converted to a numeric type, it shows as NA. In our data set, the vendor_id has NA values. We can inspect these by isolating them to determine the nature of the pattern: # Base R equivalent: # gl[is.na(gl$vendor_id), ] # Tidyverse / dplyr gl %&gt;% filter(is.na(vendor_id)) ## # A tibble: 1,000 x 9 ## je_num amount gl_date gl_date_char vendor_id account invoice_date ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 -22667. 18232 2019-12-02 NA liab_a… 18225 ## 2 2 -1397. 18228 2019-11-28 NA liab_a… 18218 ## 3 3 -2319. 17995 2019-04-09 NA liab_a… 17985 ## 4 4 -20037. 18199 2019-10-30 NA liab_a… 18189 ## 5 5 -43140. 18051 2019-06-04 NA liab_a… 18041 ## 6 6 -13603. 17927 2019-01-31 NA liab_a… 17920 ## 7 7 -7001. 18190 2019-10-21 NA liab_a… 18183 ## 8 8 -24753. 18010 2019-04-24 NA liab_a… 18003 ## 9 9 -2295. 18087 2019-07-10 NA liab_a… 18080 ## 10 10 -34263. 18060 2019-06-13 NA liab_a… 18053 ## # … with 990 more rows, and 2 more variables: description &lt;chr&gt;, ## # paid_date &lt;dbl&gt; This indicates that several values are NA. This enables us to ask the proper questions - specifically, we should seek to understand and corroborate with the business if there is a certain pattern associated to these NAs. dplyr’s group_by() and summarize() are useful for identifying these patterns further: gl %&gt;% filter(is.na(vendor_id)) %&gt;% group_by(account) %&gt;% summarize(n = n(), .groups = &#39;drop&#39;) # Needed to suppress the ungrouping object message ## # A tibble: 2 x 2 ## account n ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 liab_accountspayable_2000 990 ## 2 liab_creditcardpayable_2100 10 6.2.2 Journal Entries balance to zero A quick sanity check for the analysis of GL accounts is to do a quick summarization. In this case, you will want to group_by() and summarize() again - in this case, by the je_num will test whether all journal entries will net to zero. gl %&gt;% group_by(je_num) %&gt;% summarize(amount = sum(amount), .groups = &#39;drop&#39;) %&gt;% filter(amount != 0) ## # A tibble: 0 x 2 ## # … with 2 variables: je_num &lt;int&gt;, amount &lt;dbl&gt; 6.3 Transforming of Trial Balance data The Trial Balance (TB) is intended to track and record higher level movements of the General Ledger. It does so by maintaining an accurate balance of debits and credits made to the accounts. Lets look at our TB: tb &lt;- tbl(con, &#39;tb&#39;) %&gt;% collect() head(tb) ## # A tibble: 5 x 13 ## account activity_2019_01 activity_2019_02 activity_2019_03 activity_2019_04 ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 exp_co… 28785. 9942. 9715. 9931. ## 2 exp_ma… 1021508. 834766. 746621. 636011. ## 3 exp_me… 1.55 0 0 281. ## 4 liab_a… -1050295. -844708. -756336. -646057. ## 5 liab_c… 0 0 0 -166. ## # … with 8 more variables: activity_2019_05 &lt;dbl&gt;, activity_2019_06 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # activity_2019_07 &lt;dbl&gt;, activity_2019_08 &lt;dbl&gt;, activity_2019_09 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # activity_2019_10 &lt;dbl&gt;, activity_2019_11 &lt;dbl&gt;, activity_2019_12 &lt;dbl&gt; The TB provided has the net change or net activity level by month. In your day-to-day work, you may also receive a TB that has an Opening and Closing balance - to obtain the net change for the audit period, simply deduct the Close from the Open to calculate the Change for the year, zeroing out the ‘Open’ component for income statement accounts. In our case, we would like to perform completeness testing by account for the entire year, which means we compare the total activity of the account in the TB to the GL. As each column is its own month, we can approach this in several ways - each of the below methods demonstrates how to solve the problem. 6.3.1 Sum by absolute references In traditional “Excel-esque” form, you would add up each column for each row - simply taking the values of each column and adding them together. tb %&gt;% mutate(tb_activity = activity_2019_01 + activity_2019_02 + activity_2019_03 + activity_2019_04 + activity_2019_05 + activity_2019_06 + activity_2019_07 + activity_2019_08 + activity_2019_09 + activity_2019_10 + activity_2019_11 + activity_2019_12) %&gt;% select(account, tb_activity) ## # A tibble: 5 x 2 ## account tb_activity ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 exp_consulting_6500 248427. ## 2 exp_materials_6000 9984507. ## 3 exp_meals_7000 1706. ## 4 liab_accountspayable_2000 -10227945. ## 5 liab_creditcardpayable_2100 -6695. While the above works, there are some risks to this code: the code is difficult to read, as it is a long string of column names, is prone to errors as you have to type out each column, and this approach could only be used once, this year, as when the next audit year rolls around, you would have to manually change the references. 6.3.2 Sum by numeric position To make this code more reusable, we could make some changes. We notice that the activity columns are in the second column through the thirteenth position, so we can assume that the ‘position’ of the columns will never change - second column will always be January, and the thirteenth will be December. names(tb) # This tells us the position number of each column names ## [1] &quot;account&quot; &quot;activity_2019_01&quot; &quot;activity_2019_02&quot; &quot;activity_2019_03&quot; ## [5] &quot;activity_2019_04&quot; &quot;activity_2019_05&quot; &quot;activity_2019_06&quot; &quot;activity_2019_07&quot; ## [9] &quot;activity_2019_08&quot; &quot;activity_2019_09&quot; &quot;activity_2019_10&quot; &quot;activity_2019_11&quot; ## [13] &quot;activity_2019_12&quot; names(tb)[2] # Returns January ## [1] &quot;activity_2019_01&quot; names(tb)[13] # Returns December ## [1] &quot;activity_2019_12&quot; Therefore, we can reference a range of column numbers in our script: tb %&gt;% select(2:13) # Selects just the numeric columns that we assume, by column number ## # A tibble: 5 x 12 ## activity_2019_01 activity_2019_02 activity_2019_03 activity_2019_04 ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 28785. 9942. 9715. 9931. ## 2 1021508. 834766. 746621. 636011. ## 3 1.55 0 0 281. ## 4 -1050295. -844708. -756336. -646057. ## 5 0 0 0 -166. ## # … with 8 more variables: activity_2019_05 &lt;dbl&gt;, activity_2019_06 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # activity_2019_07 &lt;dbl&gt;, activity_2019_08 &lt;dbl&gt;, activity_2019_09 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # activity_2019_10 &lt;dbl&gt;, activity_2019_11 &lt;dbl&gt;, activity_2019_12 &lt;dbl&gt; And now we can summarize by row tb_activity &lt;- tb %&gt;% select(2:13) %&gt;% rowSums() # And sums up the row print(tb_activity) # This is saved as a numeric vector ## [1] 248426.92 9984507.34 1705.97 -10227945.12 -6695.11 The newly calculated row summarization will return the total activity as a numeric vector; each item in the vector represents which row it belonged to. As this is a vector of numbers, we can a vector of the same TB account names and join them together. print(tb$account) # Vector of account names as a character ## [1] &quot;exp_consulting_6500&quot; &quot;exp_materials_6000&quot; ## [3] &quot;exp_meals_7000&quot; &quot;liab_accountspayable_2000&quot; ## [5] &quot;liab_creditcardpayable_2100&quot; With these two vectors, we can create a new data frame with the account name and TB activity we calculated. data.frame(account = tb$account, tb_activity = tb_activity) # We create a new dataframe - one from the character vector in the original trial balance file, the other from the created tb_activity ## account tb_activity ## 1 exp_consulting_6500 248426.92 ## 2 exp_materials_6000 9984507.34 ## 3 exp_meals_7000 1705.97 ## 4 liab_accountspayable_2000 -10227945.12 ## 5 liab_creditcardpayable_2100 -6695.11 6.3.3 Sum by named references In addition of referencing by position number, we can also reference by column name. We want to sum up all columns that start with “activity_”. The selecting by position and selecting by variable name are similar, so we’ll also introduce the ‘dot’ in this select statement. tb %&gt;% mutate(tb_activity = rowSums( select(., contains(&#39;activity_&#39;)) # Only keep the column names with the word &#39;activity_&#39; )) %&gt;% select(account, tb_activity) ## # A tibble: 5 x 2 ## account tb_activity ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 exp_consulting_6500 248427. ## 2 exp_materials_6000 9984507. ## 3 exp_meals_7000 1706. ## 4 liab_accountspayable_2000 -10227945. ## 5 liab_creditcardpayable_2100 -6695. What occurs here is that the dot will take the preceding command (technically known as the ‘left hand side’ or LHS) and feed it directly into the function. So in this case, the command can be narrated as: Using the TB table (this becomes our LHS), create a column named “tb_activity”… Calculate “tb_activity” by identifying all column names containing the word “activity_” from the TB table (referenced by the dot). Using these columns, add them together with rowSums. By introducing and referencing our columns by names, we’ve introduced a more specific and robust way to aggregate our information by account. 6.3.4 Pivot then summarize While the prior methods focused on summing up multiple columns, you could also approach this problem as if it was a wide data set that needed to become long. The ability to pivot data longer and wider is incredibly useful - not only for cleaning, but also for reshaping data into other formats for plotting and preparing for databases. If we look at our original TB data again, we notice there is: one unique identifier (the account name), multiple values for each month (example, activity_2019_01 represents the period with a value January 2019), and the dollar value itself for each month. When we deconstruct our data, it becomes much easier to delve into the tidyr package and the functions pivot_longer() and pivot_wider(). We will discuss the details of pivoting in cleaning data. head(tb) %&gt;% DT::datatable(options = list(scrollX = TRUE)) # Notice how this data looks wide tb_long &lt;- tb %&gt;% pivot_longer(cols = starts_with(&quot;activity_&quot;), # We want to aggregate the values in these columns names_to = &quot;period&quot;, # What we want to call this new column values_to = &quot;activity&quot;) # And the values we want to take from it tb_long ## # A tibble: 60 x 3 ## account period activity ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 exp_consulting_6500 activity_2019_01 28785. ## 2 exp_consulting_6500 activity_2019_02 9942. ## 3 exp_consulting_6500 activity_2019_03 9715. ## 4 exp_consulting_6500 activity_2019_04 9931. ## 5 exp_consulting_6500 activity_2019_05 28973. ## 6 exp_consulting_6500 activity_2019_06 37677. ## 7 exp_consulting_6500 activity_2019_07 19295. ## 8 exp_consulting_6500 activity_2019_08 9104. ## 9 exp_consulting_6500 activity_2019_09 28698. ## 10 exp_consulting_6500 activity_2019_10 28753. ## # … with 50 more rows This data is now represented longer - there is now one unique value (activity) for each account and month. From here, we can now summarize(): tb_long %&gt;% group_by(account) %&gt;% summarize(tb_activity = sum(activity)) ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument) ## # A tibble: 5 x 2 ## account tb_activity ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 exp_consulting_6500 248427. ## 2 exp_materials_6000 9984507. ## 3 exp_meals_7000 1706. ## 4 liab_accountspayable_2000 -10227945. ## 5 liab_creditcardpayable_2100 -6695. While any of these approaches will work to calculate the trial balance of activity, there are sustainability advantages where the columns are not verbatim and explicitly mentioned - what matters is how you believe your dataset can change over time, or how easily readable you can communicate your work to a new individual. 6.4 Asserting Completeness The practical goal before we do any further testing is to ensure we’re not wasting time with a data set that is missing information. This completeness test will help validate that we received data for twelve months of GL activity. In Journal Entry testing, this means we will compare the summarized Trial Balance file against the General Ledger entries to obtain reasonableness that our data set we received is complete. To compare both the GL and TB, we will want to aggregate the data in both datasets before joining them together. First, we will aggregate the GL: gl_summarized &lt;- gl %&gt;% group_by(account) %&gt;% summarize(gl_total = sum(amount), .groups = &#39;drop&#39;) # Needed to suppress the ungrouping object message gl_summarized ## # A tibble: 5 x 2 ## account gl_total ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 exp_consulting_6500 248427. ## 2 exp_materials_6000 9984507. ## 3 exp_meals_7000 1706. ## 4 liab_accountspayable_2000 -10227945. ## 5 liab_creditcardpayable_2100 -6695. And also aggregate the TB: tb_summarized &lt;- tb %&gt;% mutate(tb_activity = rowSums( select(., contains(&#39;activity_&#39;)) )) %&gt;% select(account, tb_activity) tb_summarized ## # A tibble: 5 x 2 ## account tb_activity ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 exp_consulting_6500 248427. ## 2 exp_materials_6000 9984507. ## 3 exp_meals_7000 1706. ## 4 liab_accountspayable_2000 -10227945. ## 5 liab_creditcardpayable_2100 -6695. 6.4.1 Joining the GL to the TB To perform a proper test of completeness, we should join both tables together. dplyr and the *_join() family of functions can be used to join tables, and also used as diagnosis tools to help debug information as well. Our GL and TB summarized datasets could be joined by the account column, prior to performing the calculation to identify differences: gl_summarized %&gt;% full_join(tb_summarized, by = &#39;account&#39;) ## # A tibble: 5 x 3 ## account gl_total tb_activity ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 exp_consulting_6500 248427. 248427. ## 2 exp_materials_6000 9984507. 9984507. ## 3 exp_meals_7000 1706. 1706. ## 4 liab_accountspayable_2000 -10227945. -10227945. ## 5 liab_creditcardpayable_2100 -6695. -6695. Once you have joined the columns together, a simple difference calculation will let you know what the differences are (if any): gl_summarized %&gt;% full_join(tb_summarized, by = &#39;account&#39;) %&gt;% mutate(tb_diff = gl_total - tb_activity) ## # A tibble: 5 x 4 ## account gl_total tb_activity tb_diff ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 exp_consulting_6500 248427. 248427. 0 ## 2 exp_materials_6000 9984507. 9984507. 0 ## 3 exp_meals_7000 1706. 1706. 0 ## 4 liab_accountspayable_2000 -10227945. -10227945. 0 ## 5 liab_creditcardpayable_2100 -6695. -6695. 0 And if you like clean working papers, simply filter to identify where the reconciliation did not work out: gl_summarized %&gt;% full_join(tb_summarized, by = &#39;account&#39;) %&gt;% mutate(tb_diff = gl_total - tb_activity) %&gt;% dplyr::filter(tb_diff != 0) ## # A tibble: 0 x 4 ## # … with 4 variables: account &lt;chr&gt;, gl_total &lt;dbl&gt;, tb_activity &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # tb_diff &lt;dbl&gt; 6.5 Cautionary notes for Completeness While performing completeness, you are proving you have a complete set of data. Exercise caution and ensure you are aware of the following: A completeness check is only as good as the data provided. In the above case, if November was completely excluded in both GL and TB, you would not be able to detect it at this stage if you did not look through the TB data to see that all twelve months were included. Using *_join() functions will generally return all combinations of matches. This is a strong motivation to ensure you have summarized rows by the join columns, prior to joining. Once you have summarized your data, the *_join() functions are far more predictable. full_join() will indicate if there are any accounts missing from either table. In our example, if the tb_summarized data had missing accounts that did exist in the gl_summarized table, the resulting tb_activity column values would show up as NA. anti_join() will show what columns are included on the left, but missing on the right. In our example, if the tb_summarized data had missing accounts that existed in the gl_summarized table, only this account would show up in the results. You may want to consider testing for invalid values or missing dates up front. While the primary goal is to ensure the datasets received are appropriate, you may want to consider validating this information earlier. The next chapter will show you how to further manipulate and test these columns. "],

Real world data is messy, and will not typically be immediately analyzable immediately after downloading. For this section we will still use the company database, along with some more packages. New packages in this chapter include lubridate and tidyr. library(dplyr) # For manipulating data library(tidyr) # For making data long and wide library(lubridate) # For date handling library(DBI) # For database connections dir.create(&quot;data&quot;, showWarnings = FALSE) download.file(url = &quot;https://github.com/jonlinca/auditanalytics/raw/master/data/rauditanalytics.sqlite&quot;, destfile = &quot;data/rauditanalytics.sqlite&quot;, mode = &quot;wb&quot;) con &lt;- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), &quot;data/rauditanalytics.sqlite&quot;) gl &lt;- tbl(con, &#39;gl&#39;) %&gt;% collect() vendors &lt;- tbl(con, &#39;vendors&#39;) %&gt;% collect() industry &lt;- dbReadTable(con, &#39;industry&#39;) %&gt;% collect() dbDisconnect(con) 7.1 Basic math We covered some of the basic operators in R in the Completeness chapter, so we’ll cover some more calculations and transformations. x &lt;- c(1, 2, 3) y &lt;- c(4, 5, 6) The basic mathematical symbols will calculate a vector with a position element against a different vector with the same position. In this case, the first number in x is added to the first number in y resulting in the first calculation, the second number in x is added to the second number in y resulting in the second calculation, and so on. y + x ## [1] 5 7 9 This distinction is important - vectorization allows R to be fast, but it changes how the user needs to understand objects. sum() is fairly straight forward - it will add all the elements given, together: sum(x) ## [1] 6 If you specify multiple vectors - it will merely combine them all together, equivalent to sum(c(1, 2, 3), c(4, 5, 6)): sum(x, y) ## [1] 21 We mentioned in the prior chapter about NA values, which were ‘Not Available’ or Missing Values. It becomes important to understand the implication of them in your calculations. For example, when a NA value exists in a vector, you will get an NA by default: z &lt;- c(1, 2, NA) sum(z) ## [1] NA While sum(), and several other functions like mean(), min() and max() all generally behave in predictable manners, they all have an argument of na.rm = FALSE by default (enter ?sum to see this argument in the help file. The reason why FALSE is by default is that it brings attention to the vector missing values. If you want to perform the calculation on this, you either need to substitute the NA out for a value (imputation), or simply ignore them. Both these decisions require professional judgment before substitution or ignoring. To substitute NA for a value (for example, 10): is.na(z) # Shows which positions in the vector have an NA value ## [1] FALSE FALSE TRUE z[is.na(z)] &lt;- 10 # Where the z value is is.na, assign 10 sum(z) ## [1] 13 Or alternatively, set the argument na.rm = TRUE to throw away these values completely: z &lt;- c(1, 2, NA) sum(z, na.rm = TRUE) ## [1] 3 7.2 Dates and Times Unlike numbers, date and times are inherently more complex. They require many additional considerations to properly wrangle: What format is the date and time in? Are the timezones as expected? This also applies for dates. Do you want the the month the transaction took place in? The year? The day-of-week? Do you care about daylight savings time? Starting with a basic example, lets understand the basic characteristics of dates. When you define a new date, the lubridate::as_date() function (or base as.Date()) works to convert character strings to dates. startString &lt;- &#39;2020-07-30&#39; # ISO 8601 standards, follow them # base::as.Date(startString) # Same thing as as_date, for now... start &lt;- lubridate::as_date(startString) class(start) ## [1] &quot;Date&quot; You can convert any date to a date, as long as you specify the mask or format. A mask specifies where the date, month, year exist (as well as for time, hours, minutes, seconds). If you check the help file for ?strptime, you will see several different formats for both specifying dates and times. For example, %Y is a four digit year while %y% is a two digit year. Here are a few examples with the same date (some are more unreasonable than others, but all can be captured): lubridate::as_date(&#39;2020-07-30&#39;, format = &quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;) lubridate::as_date(&#39;30/07/2020&#39;, format = &quot;%d/%m/%Y&quot;) # Not ISO 8601 lubridate::as_date(&#39;July 30, 20&#39;, format = &quot;%B %d, %y&quot;) # Really not ISO 8601 lubridate::as_date(&#39;Jul3020&#39;, format = &quot;%b%d%y&quot;) # Definitely not ISO 8601 The same concept also applies to datetimes, where you can convert a given time to a ‘POSIXct’ or ‘POSIXlt’ format (the differences between ‘POSIXct’ and ‘POSIXlt’ are found in ?DateTimeClasses, under details): starttime_base &lt;- as.POSIXct(&#39;2020-07-30 12:00:00&#39;) starttime_lub &lt;- lubridate::as_datetime(&#39;2020-07-30 12:00:00&#39;) class(starttime_base); class(starttime_lub) ## [1] &quot;POSIXct&quot; &quot;POSIXt&quot; ## [1] &quot;POSIXct&quot; &quot;POSIXt&quot; And format masks apply as well to date time, just in case you get something unconventional: lubridate::as_datetime(&#39;2020-07-30 12:00:00 PM -0600&#39;, format = &quot;%Y-%m-%d %I:%M:%S %p %z&quot;) ## [1] &quot;2020-07-30 18:00:00 UTC&quot; 7.2.1 Understanding Default Time Zones Did you consider the time zone that the times were created in? This is system-specific and base POSIXct and lubridate as_datetime behave differently, so you have to be careful! print(starttime_base); attr(starttime_base,&quot;tzone&quot;) ## [1] &quot;2020-07-30 12:00:00 MDT&quot; ## [1] &quot;&quot; Notice that base treats the creation of the current timezone based off your local R machine, although its not extractable (and you will eventually find, hard to change). print(starttime_lub); tz(starttime_lub) ## [1] &quot;2020-07-30 12:00:00 UTC&quot; ## [1] &quot;UTC&quot; The lubridate version will assign the date-time automatically to UTC, unless you specify it. It is for this reason you will generally want to avoid using base R to convert to date times, and stick with lubridate for better predictability. Having an automatic conversion to UTC isn’t bad per se - having a universal ground truth to UTC is good, as it removes Daylight Saving component, and is an easy way to standardize multiple data sets together. Unfortunately, many systems will not tell you what time zone their data is in, so you will have to figure it out and ensure R is aligned accordingly. 7.2.2 Override or display timezones Hopefully you have been convinced to stick with lubridate for your date transformations. Now, lets get some confidence on these timezone transformations. The first method is force_tz(), which forces the current time to become that same hour in a new timezone. When we assigned July 30th to the date, we would have assumed this date would have been in the current timezone we exist in (generally, the system time-zone you are in). To do this, specify the date, but also the time zone you want the date or time to be harmonized in: starttime_lub # Starts as UTC ## [1] &quot;2020-07-30 12:00:00 UTC&quot; force_tz(starttime_lub, tz = &#39;Canada/Mountain&#39;) # Force the saved time to be Mountain ## [1] &quot;2020-07-30 12:00:00 MDT&quot; Alternatively, you may wish to only convert the time so its displayed in the correct timezone, but leave the base truth as is. with_tz() will allow you to change the timezone that is displayed, while honoring the original time in the data. starttime_lub ## [1] &quot;2020-07-30 12:00:00 UTC&quot; with_tz(starttime_lub, tz = &#39;Canada/Mountain&#39;) # Display the current time as Mountain ## [1] &quot;2020-07-30 06:00:00 MDT&quot; 7.2.3 Daylight Saving Implications There are also timezone implications when it comes to daylight saving time. This is especially important when making audit decisions based on duration, or expected local norms for time-of-day. In several locales across the world, daylight saving time will alter the clock for half a year locally, but has no impact on UTC. For example, your staff may start their day at 8:00 AM locally. When daylight saving kicks in, the local time stays at 8:00 AM and the UTC time shifts from 15:00 to 14:00. pre &lt;- as_datetime(&#39;2020-03-07 8:00:00&#39;, tz = &#39;Canada/Mountain&#39;) # The day before DST starts post &lt;- as_datetime(&#39;2020-03-08 8:00:00&#39;, tz = &#39;Canada/Mountain&#39;) # The day DST started dst(pre); with_tz(pre, tz = &#39;UTC&#39;) # Was DST active before? ; What is the UTC time before? ## [1] FALSE ## [1] &quot;2020-03-07 15:00:00 UTC&quot; dst(post); with_tz(post, tz = &#39;UTC&#39;) # Was DST active after? ; What is the UTC time after? ## [1] TRUE ## [1] &quot;2020-03-08 14:00:00 UTC&quot; 7.2.4 Differences between time Another common calculation is to calculate the time differences between two points of time. This seemingly simple action has several interpretations behind it. Do you want relative dates? Do you want exact elapsed time? People are not always consistent in how they expect time to behave. Sometimes the passage of time is a monotone progression of instants that should be as mathematically reliable as the number line. On other occasions time must follow complex conventions and rules so that the clock times we see reflect what we expect to observe in terms of daylight, season, and congruence with the atomic clock. (Vitalie Spinu 2016) Adding time is easy - you simply need to decide if you’re adding a period (i.e. human construct of days) or if you are following physical time (i.e. seconds). The main difference is choosing lubridate’s functions that honor periods or durations pre &lt;- as_datetime(&#39;2020-03-07 8:00:00&#39;, tz = &#39;Canada/Mountain&#39;) # The day before DST starts post &lt;- as_datetime(&#39;2020-03-08 8:00:00&#39;, tz = &#39;Canada/Mountain&#39;) # The day DST started, skipped ahead 1 hour # Periods: Human construct of days pre + days(1) ; pre + hours(24) # Equal to post, the human construct ## [1] &quot;2020-03-08 08:00:00 MDT&quot; ## [1] &quot;2020-03-08 08:00:00 MDT&quot; # Duration: Physical construct of time pre + ddays(1) ; pre + dhours(24) # NOT to post, but actually 1 hour after ## [1] &quot;2020-03-08 09:00:00 MDT&quot; ## [1] &quot;2020-03-08 09:00:00 MDT&quot; Calculating intervals and periods is a bit different. If we go back up to our example of pre-and-post daylight saving time, we can either expect this answer to be 1 day or 23 hours. Again, depending on your use case, it is up to you.1 span &lt;- interval(pre, post) # Period: To find the number of days, in human constructs span / days(1) # Period calculation by days. ## [1] 1 # Duration - To find the hours between, in physical constructs as.duration(span) ## [1] &quot;82800s (~23 hours)&quot; 7.2.5 Derived date information A common task for auditors is to find out the month a transaction took place in. With lubridate, its quite straight forward - for example, to extract the month, you don’t need to have any messy substrings (or to extract other useful times, for that matter): thedate &lt;- as_datetime(&#39;2020-07-01 12:00:00&#39;, tz = &#39;Canada/Mountain&#39;) month(thedate) ## [1] 7 year(thedate) ## [1] 2020 quarter(thedate) # Canada Day starts on the first day of the third quarter. Does your company Financial Year not start on January 1? Just change the fiscal_start argument. ## [1] 3 wday(thedate, label = TRUE) ## [1] Wed ## Levels: Sun &lt; Mon &lt; Tue &lt; Wed &lt; Thu &lt; Fri &lt; Sat 7.2.6 Cleaning numerical dates With dates, sometimes they may represented as a number - it is important to understand your source system date before you convert it. Some systems may calculate a date from an ‘origin’ using the number. While our concept of time may start with 0 AD (as the origin), several computer systems and applications do not behave in that manner. Excel, for example, starts from 1900-01-01, whereas Unix operating systems have their origin as 1970-01-01. If converting a date from a number, you need to research and then specify an origin, otherwise you will have challenges in specifying dates. In our vendors table, we have a numeric date but also a date in a character form for reference vendors %&gt;% select(date_added, date_added_char) ## # A tibble: 9 x 2 ## date_added date_added_char ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 16631 2015-07-15 ## 2 16644 2015-07-28 ## 3 16581 2015-05-26 ## 4 16578 2015-05-23 ## 5 16620 2015-07-04 ## 6 16652 2015-08-05 ## 7 16578 2015-05-23 ## 8 16620 2015-07-04 ## 9 16652 2015-08-05 By specifying the origin a few different origins, we can see what the origin should have been in this case: vendors %&gt;% select(date_added, date_added_char) %&gt;% mutate(date_added_unix = as_date(date_added, origin = &#39;1970-01-01&#39;), date_added_excel = as_date(date_added, origin = &#39;1900-01-01&#39;)) ## # A tibble: 9 x 4 ## date_added date_added_char date_added_unix date_added_excel ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;date&gt; &lt;date&gt; ## 1 16631 2015-07-15 2015-07-15 1945-07-15 ## 2 16644 2015-07-28 2015-07-28 1945-07-28 ## 3 16581 2015-05-26 2015-05-26 1945-05-26 ## 4 16578 2015-05-23 2015-05-23 1945-05-23 ## 5 16620 2015-07-04 2015-07-04 1945-07-04 ## 6 16652 2015-08-05 2015-08-05 1945-08-05 ## 7 16578 2015-05-23 2015-05-23 1945-05-23 ## 8 16620 2015-07-04 2015-07-04 1945-07-04 ## 9 16652 2015-08-05 2015-08-05 1945-08-05 Dates can also appear in a completely different format. Julian (also known as mainframe or ordinal) dates are an example, where the year is specified but the date is relative to January 1. So 212 days is either July 30 or 31, depending if it is a leap year or not. lubridate::as_date(&#39;19212&#39;, format = &quot;%y%j&quot;) ## [1] &quot;2019-07-31&quot; lubridate::as_date(&#39;20212&#39;, format = &quot;%y%j&quot;) ## [1] &quot;2020-07-30&quot; JDE E1’s dates also add an extra digit in front of it, to symbolize the century. While there is no R way to translate 0 to 19xx and 1 to 20xx, practically speaking we are safe with assuming the century as we are at least 20 years past that point (as of this writing). Amending the mask to ignore the 1 can be done in the format: lubridate::as_date(&#39;119212&#39;, format = &quot;1%y%j&quot;) ## [1] &quot;2019-07-31&quot; lubridate::as_date(&#39;120212&#39;, format = &quot;1%y%j&quot;) ## [1] &quot;2020-07-30&quot; 7.3 Separate Occasionally, distinct data will be combined in the same cell. This can be due to data entry or an unusual method of storing information. There will generally a separator within the field (similar to a delimiter), but the data is still contained within one field. For example, if we look at our vendor table and name column, we can see the company names appear to also have a Contact person. vendors %&gt;% select(type, name) ## # A tibble: 9 x 2 ## type name ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 E al-Bangura, Habeeba ## 2 E Akina, Duncan ## 3 E el-Kazmi, Muneefa ## 4 V el-Shafi Company Ltd - Contact: Rivera, Evan ## 5 V Bray Company Ltd - Contact: el-Jaffer, Shaheer ## 6 V Chrisman Company Ltd - Contact: Burch, Kryslyn ## 7 V el-Shafi Company Ltd - Contact: Rivera, Evan ## 8 V Bray Company Ltd - Contact: el-Jaffer, Shaheer ## 9 V Chrisman Company Ltd - Contact: Burch, Kryslyn While the name is accurate, the contact name shouldn’t be in there. We can isolate the contact name by using separate(), allowing us to split a column by defining a separator and also new column names. In this case, the ‘-’ (dash) character could work: vendors %&gt;% select(type, name) %&gt;% separate(name, c(&#39;name&#39;, &#39;company_contact&#39;), sep = &#39;-&#39;) ## Warning: Expected 2 pieces. Additional pieces discarded in 4 rows [4, 5, 7, 8]. ## Warning: Expected 2 pieces. Missing pieces filled with `NA` in 1 rows [2]. ## # A tibble: 9 x 3 ## type name company_contact ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 E &quot;al&quot; &quot;Bangura, Habeeba&quot; ## 2 E &quot;Akina, Duncan&quot; &lt;NA&gt; ## 3 E &quot;el&quot; &quot;Kazmi, Muneefa&quot; ## 4 V &quot;el&quot; &quot;Shafi Company Ltd &quot; ## 5 V &quot;Bray Company Ltd &quot; &quot; Contact: el&quot; ## 6 V &quot;Chrisman Company Ltd &quot; &quot; Contact: Burch, Kryslyn&quot; ## 7 V &quot;el&quot; &quot;Shafi Company Ltd &quot; ## 8 V &quot;Bray Company Ltd &quot; &quot; Contact: el&quot; ## 9 V &quot;Chrisman Company Ltd &quot; &quot; Contact: Burch, Kryslyn&quot; Sometimes a character isn’t specific enough. We can actually customize the separator even further by changing its argument to be more specific. In this case, perhaps we want both the dash and the word “Contact:”: vendors %&gt;% select(id, type, name) %&gt;% separate(name, c(&#39;name&#39;, &#39;company_contact&#39;), sep = &#39;- Contact:&#39;) ## Warning: Expected 2 pieces. Missing pieces filled with `NA` in 3 rows [1, 2, 3]. ## # A tibble: 9 x 4 ## id type name company_contact ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 793 E &quot;al-Bangura, Habeeba&quot; &lt;NA&gt; ## 2 666 E &quot;Akina, Duncan&quot; &lt;NA&gt; ## 3 77 E &quot;el-Kazmi, Muneefa&quot; &lt;NA&gt; ## 4 2726 V &quot;el-Shafi Company Ltd &quot; &quot; Rivera, Evan&quot; ## 5 2612 V &quot;Bray Company Ltd &quot; &quot; el-Jaffer, Shaheer&quot; ## 6 2211 V &quot;Chrisman Company Ltd &quot; &quot; Burch, Kryslyn&quot; ## 7 2726 V &quot;el-Shafi Company Ltd &quot; &quot; Rivera, Evan&quot; ## 8 2612 V &quot;Bray Company Ltd &quot; &quot; el-Jaffer, Shaheer&quot; ## 9 2211 V &quot;Chrisman Company Ltd &quot; &quot; Burch, Kryslyn&quot; What is nice about this functionality is that if the separator isn’t found, the missing values are NA. The warning is good to see (as the employees don’t have a company contact), and can be safely ignored in this case. 7.4 Separate_rows Similarly grouped data can also be combined in the same cell. This is typically representing a one-to-many (or many-to-one) relationship. This can be due to data entry or unusual output formats. Consider our industry table, which is an industry-to-company mapping table, telling us which companies and the respective industry they work in: industry ## id industry ## 1 2726 Health Care ## 2 2612,2211 Commerical Supplies As of now, there would be no way to join the industry, and specifically the value Commercial Supplies, into our vendor table. The unique key is id number of the company, which gets joined to the vendor table. When we run into a situation where a value may belong to the same key multiple times (multiple IDs are associated with one industry), we can use separate_rows() to break up that row into several rows. For this function, we need to specify the columns that need to be separated - in this case, id needs to be broken apart. clean_industry &lt;- industry %&gt;% separate_rows(id, convert = TRUE) # Convert will try to guess the data type for each field, based on the content that was separated print(clean_industry) ## # A tibble: 3 x 2 ## id industry ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 2726 Health Care ## 2 2612 Commerical Supplies ## 3 2211 Commerical Supplies separate_rows() will automatically expand the column that needs to be separated, while replicating the content for that same value into subsequent rows. 7.5 Tidy data The three key concepts in ‘tidy data’ (Hadley Wickham 2017) is that: Each variable must have its own column. Each observation must have its own row. Each value must have its own cell. While you can get away with performing basic analysis and checks, having the ability to move data between formats increases competency for cleaning, flexibility for plotting, and legibility for outputting tables in a readable format. Lets start by cleaning the vendor table clean_vendors &lt;- vendors %&gt;% separate(name, c(&#39;name&#39;, &#39;company_contact&#39;), sep = &#39;- Contact: &#39;) %&gt;% # From the separate() section select(-date_added_char) %&gt;% # Remove one of the date fields mutate(date_added = as_date(date_added, origin = &#39;1970-01-01&#39;)) %&gt;% # From the cleaning dates section filter(type == &#39;V&#39;) ## Warning: Expected 2 pieces. Missing pieces filled with `NA` in 3 rows [1, 2, 3]. print(clean_vendors) ## # A tibble: 6 x 10 ## id type name company_contact date_added summary `2015` `2016` `2017` ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;date&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2726 V &quot;el-… Rivera, Evan 2015-05-23 spend 65326. 8.34e4 1.50e5 ## 2 2612 V &quot;Bra… el-Jaffer, Sha… 2015-07-04 spend 88270. 1.49e5 2.54e5 ## 3 2211 V &quot;Chr… Burch, Kryslyn 2015-08-05 spend 51847. 8.93e4 1.42e5 ## 4 2726 V &quot;el-… Rivera, Evan 2015-05-23 credits 509. 8.60e2 9.09e2 ## 5 2612 V &quot;Bra… el-Jaffer, Sha… 2015-07-04 credits 777. 1.09e3 1.85e3 ## 6 2211 V &quot;Chr… Burch, Kryslyn 2015-08-05 credits 221. 3.69e2 6.57e2 ## # … with 1 more variable: `2018` &lt;dbl&gt; This vendor data set is a combination of both long and wide, and needs to be standardized to fit the tidy data model. Specifically: Each variable must have its own column - The vendor’s spend and credits each year is separated over multiple columns. That is, the values of the variable (the year) is in the column name. In the end output, every combination of vendor-year should be a row. Each observation must have its own row - Each vendor has both a spend and credits value, within the summary column. Even though these are one observation for each vendor-year, they are separated by two rows. Each value must have its own cell - Thankfully, this seems to be valid (although if not, you can clean it with separate() and separate_rows()). Why would you want to subscribe to this tidy data philosophy? When you have a tidy data set, you are more empowered to explore your data (especially with tidyverse related commands), but you can also have the power to reshape data as necessary to fit the visualizing output you are imagining. 7.6 Pivots, wide and longer Effectively pivoting your data into more suitable columns and rows requires you to consider the following: What columns contains the values you want to aggregate? What do you want the new name of these columns to be? Consider both the name and aggregated value. In the clean_vendors data, we see each year represented as columns, and those columns represent dollar amounts. clean_vendors ## # A tibble: 6 x 10 ## id type name company_contact date_added summary `2015` `2016` `2017` ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;date&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2726 V &quot;el-… Rivera, Evan 2015-05-23 spend 65326. 8.34e4 1.50e5 ## 2 2612 V &quot;Bra… el-Jaffer, Sha… 2015-07-04 spend 88270. 1.49e5 2.54e5 ## 3 2211 V &quot;Chr… Burch, Kryslyn 2015-08-05 spend 51847. 8.93e4 1.42e5 ## 4 2726 V &quot;el-… Rivera, Evan 2015-05-23 credits 509. 8.60e2 9.09e2 ## 5 2612 V &quot;Bra… el-Jaffer, Sha… 2015-07-04 credits 777. 1.09e3 1.85e3 ## 6 2211 V &quot;Chr… Burch, Kryslyn 2015-08-05 credits 221. 3.69e2 6.57e2 ## # … with 1 more variable: `2018` &lt;dbl&gt; We can pivot this data by specifying the years, and then aggregating the amount. In this case, we want to take the columns and assign them to rows, and making the data longer. pivot_longer() will allow us to make this transformation: clean_vendors %&gt;% pivot_longer(cols = c(`2015`, `2016`, `2017`, `2018`), # The columns we want to pivot, in this case, the years. names_to = &#39;year&#39;, # We want this collected column to be called the year values_to = &#39;amount&#39;) # the values of the aggregation ## # A tibble: 24 x 8 ## id type name company_contact date_added summary year amount ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;date&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2726 V &quot;el-Shafi Comp… Rivera, Evan 2015-05-23 spend 2015 6.53e4 ## 2 2726 V &quot;el-Shafi Comp… Rivera, Evan 2015-05-23 spend 2016 8.34e4 ## 3 2726 V &quot;el-Shafi Comp… Rivera, Evan 2015-05-23 spend 2017 1.50e5 ## 4 2726 V &quot;el-Shafi Comp… Rivera, Evan 2015-05-23 spend 2018 5.56e4 ## 5 2612 V &quot;Bray Company … el-Jaffer, Shahe… 2015-07-04 spend 2015 8.83e4 ## 6 2612 V &quot;Bray Company … el-Jaffer, Shahe… 2015-07-04 spend 2016 1.49e5 ## 7 2612 V &quot;Bray Company … el-Jaffer, Shahe… 2015-07-04 spend 2017 2.54e5 ## 8 2612 V &quot;Bray Company … el-Jaffer, Shahe… 2015-07-04 spend 2018 1.79e5 ## 9 2211 V &quot;Chrisman Comp… Burch, Kryslyn 2015-08-05 spend 2015 5.18e4 ## 10 2211 V &quot;Chrisman Comp… Burch, Kryslyn 2015-08-05 spend 2016 8.93e4 ## # … with 14 more rows This data is more readable - each year is on its own row. However, we still have the issue where the same company will have two rows for each year - for the summary field, both a spend and credits exist for a vendor: clean_vendors %&gt;% pivot_longer(cols = c(`2015`, `2016`, `2017`, `2018`), # The columns we want to pivot, in this case, the years. names_to = &#39;year&#39;, # We want this collected column to be called the year values_to = &#39;amount&#39;) %&gt;% # the values of the aggregation arrange(id) %&gt;% head(10) ## # A tibble: 10 x 8 ## id type name company_contact date_added summary year amount ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;date&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2211 V &quot;Chrisman Comp… Burch, Kryslyn 2015-08-05 spend 2015 5.18e4 ## 2 2211 V &quot;Chrisman Comp… Burch, Kryslyn 2015-08-05 spend 2016 8.93e4 ## 3 2211 V &quot;Chrisman Comp… Burch, Kryslyn 2015-08-05 spend 2017 1.42e5 ## 4 2211 V &quot;Chrisman Comp… Burch, Kryslyn 2015-08-05 spend 2018 7.68e4 ## 5 2211 V &quot;Chrisman Comp… Burch, Kryslyn 2015-08-05 credits 2015 2.21e2 ## 6 2211 V &quot;Chrisman Comp… Burch, Kryslyn 2015-08-05 credits 2016 3.69e2 ## 7 2211 V &quot;Chrisman Comp… Burch, Kryslyn 2015-08-05 credits 2017 6.57e2 ## 8 2211 V &quot;Chrisman Comp… Burch, Kryslyn 2015-08-05 credits 2018 4.58e2 ## 9 2612 V &quot;Bray Company … el-Jaffer, Shahe… 2015-07-04 spend 2015 8.83e4 ## 10 2612 V &quot;Bray Company … el-Jaffer, Shahe… 2015-07-04 spend 2016 1.49e5 Since spend and credits belong to a single vendor-year pairing, it may be worthwhile to to put both summary classifications into their own column. In this case, we want to make the table wider by adding columns, so lets use pivot_wider(). This function is similar to pivot_longer in the same approach: What columns contains the values you want to aggregate spread out? These values becomes the new column name. Where is the value located? These will get moved under the new column. Building from our last example, lets make this data bit wider clean_vendors %&gt;% pivot_longer(cols = c(`2015`, `2016`, `2017`, `2018`), # The columns we want to pivot, in this case, the years. names_to = &#39;year&#39;, # We want this collected column to be called the year values_to = &#39;amount&#39;) %&gt;% # the values of the aggregation pivot_wider(names_from = &#39;summary&#39;, values_from = &#39;amount&#39;) ## # A tibble: 12 x 8 ## id type name company_contact date_added year spend credits ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;date&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2726 V &quot;el-Shafi Comp… Rivera, Evan 2015-05-23 2015 6.53e4 509. ## 2 2726 V &quot;el-Shafi Comp… Rivera, Evan 2015-05-23 2016 8.34e4 860. ## 3 2726 V &quot;el-Shafi Comp… Rivera, Evan 2015-05-23 2017 1.50e5 909. ## 4 2726 V &quot;el-Shafi Comp… Rivera, Evan 2015-05-23 2018 5.56e4 348. ## 5 2612 V &quot;Bray Company … el-Jaffer, Shahe… 2015-07-04 2015 8.83e4 777. ## 6 2612 V &quot;Bray Company … el-Jaffer, Shahe… 2015-07-04 2016 1.49e5 1094. ## 7 2612 V &quot;Bray Company … el-Jaffer, Shahe… 2015-07-04 2017 2.54e5 1854. ## 8 2612 V &quot;Bray Company … el-Jaffer, Shahe… 2015-07-04 2018 1.79e5 1395. ## 9 2211 V &quot;Chrisman Comp… Burch, Kryslyn 2015-08-05 2015 5.18e4 221. ## 10 2211 V &quot;Chrisman Comp… Burch, Kryslyn 2015-08-05 2016 8.93e4 369. ## 11 2211 V &quot;Chrisman Comp… Burch, Kryslyn 2015-08-05 2017 1.42e5 657. ## 12 2211 V &quot;Chrisman Comp… Burch, Kryslyn 2015-08-05 2018 7.68e4 458. Each company now has its spend and credits in separate columns, but is now digestible by year. 7.7 Joining data Often our data will come from different data sets or different tables. Having the ability to combine data from different systems is a powerful way to add more analyzable information from your dataset. In the Completeness chapter, we joined accounts from both the GL and TB to calculate whether there were any differences. The Relational Data chapter in R for Data Science goes into depth how the different join operations work. References "],

Realistically, you will oscillate between cleaning and exploration before you are able to better understand the data you are looking testing. There are many primarily two methods in exploring data, both quantitatively and visually. Both are necessary methods for understanding data, at a quantitative and also a human level. For this section we will still use the same company database, and also another unique dataset, along with some more packages - mainly, ggplot2. library(dplyr) library(tidyr) library(lubridate) library(DBI) library(ggplot2) # For graphics dir.create(&quot;data&quot;, showWarnings = FALSE) download.file(url = &quot;https://github.com/jonlinca/auditanalytics/raw/master/data/rauditanalytics.sqlite&quot;, destfile = &quot;data/rauditanalytics.sqlite&quot;, mode = &quot;wb&quot;) con &lt;- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), &quot;data/rauditanalytics.sqlite&quot;) gl &lt;- tbl(con, &#39;gl&#39;) %&gt;% collect() dbDisconnect(con) 8.1 Basic Statistics Performing summaries, or profiling the data, is a great way to begin analyzing data. It allows you to understand general numeric performance of a group. In our GL account, we have a materials category - lets isolate by that and begin our analysis: materials &lt;- gl %&gt;% filter(account == &#39;exp_materials_6000&#39;) %&gt;% mutate(gl_date = as_date(gl_date_char)) %&gt;% # We demonstrated how to handle dates in the Cleaning chapter select(-gl_date_char) summary() gives a high level preview of each field, including the type and the statistical profile of the data table: summary(materials) ## je_num amount gl_date vendor_id ## Min. : 1.0 Min. :-18873 Min. :2019-01-01 Min. :2211 ## account invoice_date description paid_date ## Length:952 Min. :17887 Length:952 Min. :17900 ## [ reached getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) -- omitted 5 rows ] If we focus on amount, we can reproduce the same summaries as well, useful if we want to extract items relative to the criteria: min(materials$amount) ## [1] -18872.85 max(materials$amount) ## [1] 96354.61 mean(materials$amount) # The average ## [1] 10487.93 median(materials$amount) # The value in the middle between upper half and lower half. If these are different than the average, then you may expect some skew in the data set. ## [1] 6816.1 Quartiles are useful because they help you generally understand where the majority of the data lies. These also also known as quantiles (or percentiles), but they cover the same area of a normal curve. quantile(materials$amount) # Look familiar? ## 0% 25% 50% 75% 100% ## -18872.85 2771.07 6816.10 15050.09 96354.61 quantile(materials$amount)[2] # This is the 1st quartile, or the 25% quantile ## 25% ## 2771.07 quantile(materials$amount)[4] # This is the 3st quartile, or the 75% quantile ## 75% ## 15050.09 IQR(materials$amount) # The difference between 3rd and 1st quartile ## [1] 12279.02 You may have missing values in your data set that show up as NA. Its important to recognize how you will diagnose and treat NAs. If a column has NAs, you may choose to remove them by using the argument na.rm = TRUE, which simply ignores these values when performing the calculation. some_nums &lt;- c(1, 2, NA, 3, 4, 5) mean(some_nums) # Returns NA ## [1] NA mean(some_nums, na.rm = TRUE) # Removes the NA value prior to caluclating the mean ## [1] 3 In accounting, it may be important to know the absolute value of a number. They’re useful in audit situations as they help express total activity of the subject, as positive and negative values may either zero out the total or mask credit activity and reversals. They’re also useful for calculating errors, as you may be not concerned about the direction of the error (debit or credit) but the total magnitude instead. sum(materials$amount) ## [1] 9984507 abs(sum(materials$amount)) ## [1] 9984507 We can even do basic correlation plots in R of two numerical data sets: x &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4) y &lt;- c(2, 4, 6, 8) cor(x, y) # The correlation of X and Y. 1 means positively highly correlated, -1 means negatively highly coorelated, and 0 means no discerable pattern. ## [1] 1 8.2 Summarizations While calculating one-off summary statistics is useful, you may want to perform summation or summary statistics, whether by an entity (a vendor) or by time frame (month, year). R provides methods for summarizing this information, with a combination of two verbs. group_by() enables you to indicate the levels you want to aggregate (for example, by vendor or by month), summarize() requires you to create new columns to contain the calculation or aggregation you want to occur (for example, sum or mean). The materials table has a vendor_id number. We can try to perform a group_by()… materials %&gt;% group_by(vendor_id) ## # A tibble: 952 x 8 ## # Groups: vendor_id [3] ## je_num amount gl_date vendor_id account invoice_date description paid_date ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;date&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 22667. 2019-12-02 2211 exp_ma… 18225 Packaging … 18262 ## 2 2 1397. 2019-11-28 2612 exp_ma… 18218 Paper 18251 ## 3 3 2319. 2019-04-09 2612 exp_ma… 17985 Paper 18018 ## 4 4 20037. 2019-10-30 2612 exp_ma… 18189 Paper 18222 ## 5 5 43140. 2019-06-04 2612 exp_ma… 18041 Blue dye 18074 ## 6 6 13603. 2019-01-31 2726 exp_ma… 17920 Medical gr… 17930 ## 7 7 7001. 2019-10-21 2726 exp_ma… 18183 Quality co… 18193 ## 8 8 24753. 2019-04-24 2211 exp_ma… 18003 Packaging … 18040 ## 9 9 2295. 2019-07-10 2726 exp_ma… 18080 Quality co… 18090 ## 10 10 34263. 2019-06-13 2211 exp_ma… 18053 Packaging … 18090 ## # … with 942 more rows But it will return nothing. The group_by() will tell R what to group by, but not perform any additional calculations. Hence, the summarize(): materials %&gt;% group_by(vendor_id) %&gt;% summarize(total_amount = sum(amount)) ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument) ## # A tibble: 3 x 2 ## vendor_id total_amount ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2211 3650465. ## 2 2612 2951279. ## 3 2726 3382764. Summarize will isolate the data set first by the groups specified, and then perform the calculation and put the results into a new field. This works for all summary statistics as well. For example, if you want to find the number of transactions, and the highest and lowest amount charged per description: materials %&gt;% group_by(description) %&gt;% summarize(number_of_trans = n(), lowest_amount = min(amount), highest_amount = max(amount)) ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument) ## # A tibble: 11 x 4 ## description number_of_trans lowest_amount highest_amount ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Blue dye 40 1071. 43140. ## 2 Fabric cutting machines 34 432. 44950. ## 3 Face mask elastics 37 526. 42785. ## 4 Fancy cloth prints 46 294. 37269. ## 5 Meals for launch celebration 1 1630. 1630. ## 6 Medical grade filters 156 258. 57567. ## 7 Packaging and boxes 316 304. 96355. ## 8 Paper 134 284. 47748. ## 9 Partial refund for medical grad… 1 -18873. -18873. ## 10 Quality control testing supplies 169 273. 88524. ## 11 Sewing machines 18 268. 36332. 8.3 Data Visualization - Why With such useful statistical and summary functions, you may wonder why you ever need to delve into graphics. While summary statistics are fun (and perhaps, highly accurate and even ‘authoritative’), they don’t help bring to light full patterns of your data. The power of visual deduction can not be understated, especially in situations where superficially summary statistics have no issues. Consider this data set, which are merely 4 pairs of x-y values (i.e. x1 goes with y1 etc): anscombe ## x1 x2 x3 x4 y1 y2 y3 y4 ## 1 10 10 10 8 8.04 9.14 7.46 6.58 ## [ reached &#39;max&#39; / getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) -- omitted 10 rows ] If we did statistical testing on these pairs, we will notice they have nearly identical summary statistics: mean(anscombe$x1); mean(anscombe$x2); mean(anscombe$x3); mean(anscombe$x4) ## [1] 9 ## [1] 9 ## [1] 9 ## [1] 9 mean(anscombe$y1); mean(anscombe$y2); mean(anscombe$y3); mean(anscombe$y4) ## [1] 7.500909 ## [1] 7.500909 ## [1] 7.5 ## [1] 7.500909 And even their correlatons are similar: cor(anscombe$x1, anscombe$y1); cor(anscombe$x2, anscombe$y2); cor(anscombe$x3, anscombe$y3); cor(anscombe$x4, anscombe$y4) ## [1] 0.8164205 ## [1] 0.8162365 ## [1] 0.8162867 ## [1] 0.8165214 With the mean and correlation statistics, you may jump to the conclusion that these datasets may be shaped identically. However, we should seriously consider plotting the data to validate our initial assumption that the data is similar. We will use the ggplot2 to chart these x-y pairs and try to understand the data we are looking at. We’ll explain ggplot2 syntax later, so for now, focus on the graph produced. If we produce the four graphs together, what do you notice? ggplot(anscombe, aes(x = x1, y = y1)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method=&quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) + labs(title=&quot;Pair 1: Y1 over X1&quot;) ggplot(anscombe, aes(x = x2, y = y2)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method=&quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) + labs(title=&quot;Pair 2: Y2 over X2&quot;) ggplot(anscombe, aes(x = x3, y = y3)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method=&quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) + labs(title=&quot;Pair 3: Y3 over X3&quot;) ggplot(anscombe, aes(x = x4, y = y4)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method=&quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) + labs(title=&quot;Pair 4: Y4 over Y4&quot;) These four charts and scatterplots themselves are quite different! While the blue correlation line and the prior summary statistics are similar, the points all follow a different general path. Independently looking at the graphics for each one will give you different insight, and may influence your audit approach. Graphics matter a lot! 8.4 Data Visualization - How ggplot2 is the package that many consider to be one of the differentiating strengths of the R universe. It is one of the most elegant methods of visualizing data, and will help you understand your audit subject. Back to our materials analysis. materials %&gt;% arrange(gl_date) %&gt;% head() ## # A tibble: 6 x 8 ## je_num amount gl_date vendor_id account invoice_date description paid_date ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;date&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 373 13520. 2019-01-01 2612 exp_mat… 17887 Paper 17920 ## 2 951 13486. 2019-01-01 2612 exp_mat… 17887 Paper 17920 ## 3 961 16026. 2019-01-01 2726 exp_mat… 17890 Quality co… 17900 ## 4 90 3777. 2019-01-02 2612 exp_mat… 17888 Face mask … 17921 ## 5 115 13402. 2019-01-02 2211 exp_mat… 17891 Packaging … 17928 ## 6 198 2431. 2019-01-02 2612 exp_mat… 17888 Face mask … 17921 Perhaps we want to start analyzing the change over time for the amount spent. The gl_date is useful here, although there are many transactions that occur on the same date. We also have a vendor_id as well, identifying the vendor that the transaction the invoice belongs to. Generally we will want our time to be the x variable (the dependent variable), and the amount spent to be the y variable (the independent variable). We can insert the x and y into a ggplot function and generate the visualization we think may reveal useful infromation. ggplot(data = materials, mapping = aes(x = gl_date, y = amount)) + geom_point() The foundations of any ggplot are essentially: data - The data frame you want to visualize, mapping - The aesthetics, which dictate the x and y (generally for the rest of the ggplot), and geom_* - The visualization mechanism you want to apply to represent the data points. When you specify a single mapping up front, it will be used for all the subsequent geoms called. You can also specify a mapping for each geom as well, which is useful for isolating points. This foundations layer of data, mapping and geom_* allows us to call different geoms and perspectives of looking at the data. For example, histograms are useful to understand the shape of a dataset: ggplot(materials, aes(x = amount)) + # data is the first default argument, and mapping is the second geom_histogram() And boxplots are useful to understand the distribution of the data: ggplot(data = materials, aes(x = as.factor(vendor_id), y = amount)) + geom_boxplot() 8.4.1 Time-series As the gl table (and materials subset) is a time-series data, containing both the transaction date and amount, we may want to try plotting a line chart to see the movement of data over time. ggplot(data = materials, aes(x = gl_date, y = amount)) + geom_line() Since our time-series data has a relatively high resolution with detailed data, we may sometimes gain insight by aggregating data (by week, month, or even year). As of now, the data needs to be aggregated into a higher level time period. monthly_mats &lt;- materials %&gt;% mutate(gl_month = floor_date(gl_date, &#39;month&#39;)) %&gt;% # Rounds the date down to the first of the month group_by(gl_month) %&gt;% summarize(amount = sum(amount)) ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument) head(monthly_mats) ## # A tibble: 6 x 2 ## gl_month amount ## &lt;date&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2019-01-01 1021508. ## 2 2019-02-01 834766. ## 3 2019-03-01 746621. ## 4 2019-04-01 636011. ## 5 2019-05-01 953909. ## 6 2019-06-01 951240. Aggregating this same information by month may be more illustrative: ggplot(data = monthly_mats, aes(x = gl_month, y = amount)) + geom_line() 8.4.2 Facets Another powerful feature of ggplot2 is facets - that is, the ability to show how different categories of the same data may look in the same dataset. In our GL dataset, we actually had multiple types of expenses: unique(gl$account) ## [1] &quot;exp_materials_6000&quot; &quot;liab_accountspayable_2000&quot; ## [3] &quot;exp_meals_7000&quot; &quot;liab_creditcardpayable_2100&quot; ## [5] &quot;exp_consulting_6500&quot; We can pull these specific expense accounts (starting with ‘exp_’), and can choose how we want to plot them: expense &lt;- gl %&gt;% filter(account %in% c(&#39;exp_materials_6000&#39;, &#39;exp_consulting_6500&#39;, &#39;exp_meals_7000&#39;)) %&gt;% mutate(gl_date = as_date(gl_date_char), gl_month = floor_date(gl_date, &#39;month&#39;)) %&gt;% group_by(account, gl_month) %&gt;% # Need to add a new layer of grouping to preserve the account summarize(amount = sum(amount)) ## `summarise()` regrouping output by &#39;account&#39; (override with `.groups` argument) ggplot(data = expense, aes(x = gl_month, y = amount, colour = account)) + # We can specify the colour now too, depending on the geom_* geom_line() Instead of plotting them onto the same chart, we can facet_* them: ggplot(data = expense, aes(x = gl_month, y = amount, colour = account)) + geom_line() + facet_grid(. ~ account) # Syntax for variable, either in the (row ~ column)... or both!

["test.html", "Chapter 9 Test 9.1 Amount-based tests 9.2 Date-based tests 9.3 Basic Statistical tests 9.4 Unusual pattern and behaviours 9.5 Search text", " Chapter 9 Test Testing data is the act of isolating high-risk records that meet criteria. While generally the intent of data analytics within auditing is to gain 100% population coverage and associated assurance, what will inevitably happen is that process deviations are revealed as items are detected. No process is bullet-proof and exception free, and therefore the auditor should have a founded idea of their level of risk tolerance prior to testing. Testing data will then help auditors articulate the nature of the exceptions and the overall risk level. Auditors must recognize that not all tests (and lines that meet these tests) immediately ascertain that the control has failed or that something suspicious has occurred. Rather, it points to items that require further inspection and judgment. By iterating your workflow, you will be able to reduce the incidence of false positives and increase your detection rate, allowing you to focus on follow-up of higher-risk activity. For this section we will use the company GL database. library(dplyr) library(tidyr) library(lubridate) library(DBI) library(benford.analysis) dir.create(&quot;data&quot;, showWarnings = FALSE) download.file(url = &quot;https://github.com/jonlinca/auditanalytics/raw/master/data/rauditanalytics.sqlite&quot;, destfile = &quot;data/rauditanalytics.sqlite&quot;, mode = &quot;wb&quot;) con &lt;- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), &quot;data/rauditanalytics.sqlite&quot;) gl &lt;- tbl(con, &#39;gl&#39;) %&gt;% collect() %&gt;% mutate(gl_date = as_date(gl_date, origin = &#39;1970-01-01&#39;), paid_date = as_date(paid_date, origin = &#39;1970-01-01&#39;), invoice_date = as_date(invoice_date, origin = &#39;1970-01-01&#39;)) %&gt;% select(-gl_date_char) dbDisconnect(con) Our primary commands for this chapter will be mutate() and filter(). The mutate() command is useful for testing data, as it allows the auditor to add features and/or criteria to their testing. After records have been identified, filter() will extract the rows matching criteria. While you may able to directly filter() rows based on criteria, you may find it more effective to instead create the new fields with mutate() that match the filter criteria. This has benefits in the long run, including: Keeping all the tests on the same row allows for an easier way to detect any row that met multiple criteria, It is straightforward to extract the rows that meets a test, and Each new column related to a specific a criteria is akin to feature engineering, enabling the reuse of the tests for machine learning applications. My style for documenting tests is to create any additional features needed, and then create a corresponding test column, with t_ as the prefix, and isolate for these invoices to perform inspection and follow-up. There may be reasons why you may need to create separate data frame objects, so do not prescribe yourself to this method for extremely long or sophisticated steps. 9.1 Amount-based tests 9.1.1 Above threshold The most classical test is to test items that meet or exceed a material value. gl %&gt;% mutate(t_over_te = amount &gt;= 60000) %&gt;% filter(t_over_te) %&gt;% select(je_num, amount, everything()) ## # A tibble: 2 x 9 ## je_num amount gl_date vendor_id account invoice_date description paid_date ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;date&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;date&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;date&gt; ## 1 140 96355. 2019-12-19 2211 exp_ma… 2019-12-12 Packaging … 2020-01-18 ## 2 693 88524. 2019-08-13 2726 exp_ma… 2019-08-06 Quality co… 2019-08-16 ## # … with 1 more variable: t_over_te &lt;lgl&gt; When performing amount or threshold testing, you may be more interested in the actual magnitude, and not necessarily the direction. This is especially true within accounting matters, where the implication of negative and positive amounts change depending on the transaction - i.e., a debit or a credit transaction, or affecting a balance sheet or income statement account can tell a very different story. In these cases, you may want to consider using absolute values as the comparison. This allows you to capture the magnitude of the change: gl %&gt;% mutate(t_over_te = abs(amount) &gt;= 60000) %&gt;% filter(t_over_te) ## # A tibble: 4 x 9 ## je_num amount gl_date vendor_id account invoice_date description ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;date&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;date&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 140 96355. 2019-12-19 2211 exp_ma… 2019-12-12 Packaging … ## 2 140 -96355. 2019-12-19 NA liab_a… 2019-12-12 Packaging … ## 3 693 88524. 2019-08-13 2726 exp_ma… 2019-08-06 Quality co… ## 4 693 -88524. 2019-08-13 NA liab_a… 2019-08-06 Quality co… ## # … with 2 more variables: paid_date &lt;date&gt;, t_over_te &lt;lgl&gt; 9.1.2 Round numbers In the forensic accounting, auditors tend to take the position that transactions rarely end in whole dollars, especially if they end in multiples of 5, or even in multiples of tens. Detection of these is contingent on the use of %%, better known as the modulo operator. It will calculate the remainder of a division calculation; dividing 1.50 by 1 will give you a remainder of 0.5. 1.50 %% 1 ## [1] 0.5 This same approach can be used to detect if a transaction is round, i.e. has no ‘cents’ in it. How you decide to apply this can be useful in many cases. For example, finding a transaction that happens to be cleanly in the ‘thousands’, perform the modulo by the corresponding amount and look for results where the remainder is 0. 15000 %% 1000 ## [1] 0 Or even a round five number, which has its use cases when it comes to things like gift cards or tipping at restaurants: 25 %% 5 ## [1] 0 When implementing as a test, I’d encourage creating multiple tests to see which test it matched, and then detect these variations together: gl %&gt;% mutate(t_round_5 = amount %% 5 == 0, t_round_10 = amount %% 10 == 0, t_round_100 = amount %% 100 == 0, t_round_1000 = amount %% 1000 == 0) %&gt;% filter_at(vars(starts_with(&quot;t_round&quot;)), any_vars(.)) %&gt;% select(je_num, amount, starts_with(&quot;t_round&quot;)) ## # A tibble: 2 x 6 ## je_num amount t_round_5 t_round_10 t_round_100 t_round_1000 ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; ## 1 621 12800 TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE ## 2 621 -12800 TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE 9.2 Date-based tests 9.2.1 Weekend testing As a typical office business (along with office activities) generally happen on the weekday - that is, Monday through Friday. We may be interested in selecting journal entries from a sample of activities that occurred on the weekend. To test this, we can use the lubridate package to determine what day of week our entry falls upon: gl &lt;- gl %&gt;% mutate(day_of_week = wday(gl_date, label = TRUE), # Label is useful if you tend to forget what each number means t_weekend = day_of_week %in% c(&#39;Sat&#39;, &#39;Sun&#39;)) gl %&gt;% filter(t_weekend) %&gt;% head() ## # A tibble: 6 x 10 ## je_num amount gl_date vendor_id account invoice_date description ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;date&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;date&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 54 35758. 2019-01-12 2612 exp_ma… 2019-01-02 Face mask … ## 2 54 -35758. 2019-01-12 NA liab_a… 2019-01-02 Face mask … ## 3 102 50135. 2019-01-12 2726 exp_ma… 2019-01-05 Medical gr… ## 4 102 -50135. 2019-01-12 NA liab_a… 2019-01-05 Medical gr… ## 5 223 50128. 2019-01-12 2211 exp_ma… 2019-01-05 Packaging … ## 6 223 -50128. 2019-01-12 NA liab_a… 2019-01-05 Packaging … ## # … with 3 more variables: paid_date &lt;date&gt;, day_of_week &lt;ord&gt;, t_weekend &lt;lgl&gt; 9.2.2 Cutoff testing When transactions are near the end of the month (or the end of the year), cutoff testing helps establish that the transactions were recorded within the correct time period. Testing these may require selecting invoices close to month end. Similar to how we calculate the period using floor_date(), we can take any date and transform it with ceiling_date() which will calculate the last date of the month. Then we can test to see if a date falls within the range as needed. gl %&gt;% mutate(end_of_month = ceiling_date(gl_date, unit = &#39;month&#39;)) %&gt;% select(gl_date, end_of_month) %&gt;% head() ## # A tibble: 6 x 2 ## gl_date end_of_month ## &lt;date&gt; &lt;date&gt; ## 1 2019-12-02 2020-01-01 ## 2 2019-12-02 2020-01-01 ## 3 2019-11-28 2019-12-01 ## 4 2019-11-28 2019-12-01 ## 5 2019-04-09 2019-05-01 ## 6 2019-04-09 2019-05-01 This is close, but all these dates are representative of the beginning of the following month. To transform dates, simply use the unit as desired and treat it like a math calculation. As all these dates are one day ahead, a days difference calculation will suffice: gl &lt;- gl %&gt;% mutate(end_of_month = ceiling_date(gl_date, unit = &#39;month&#39;) - days(1)) gl %&gt;% select(gl_date, end_of_month) %&gt;% head() ## # A tibble: 6 x 2 ## gl_date end_of_month ## &lt;date&gt; &lt;date&gt; ## 1 2019-12-02 2019-12-31 ## 2 2019-12-02 2019-12-31 ## 3 2019-11-28 2019-11-30 ## 4 2019-11-28 2019-11-30 ## 5 2019-04-09 2019-04-30 ## 6 2019-04-09 2019-04-30 And to detect which lines are close to month end, simply calculate the difference between the end of month and the original date, keeping only dates very close to the end of the month: gl %&gt;% mutate(t_cutoff = (end_of_month - gl_date) &lt;= 1) %&gt;% # Find entries on or one day prior to month end filter(t_cutoff) %&gt;% select(je_num, gl_date, t_cutoff, everything()) ## # A tibble: 136 x 12 ## je_num gl_date t_cutoff amount vendor_id account invoice_date description ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;date&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;date&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 4 2019-10-30 TRUE 20037. 2612 exp_ma… 2019-10-20 Paper ## 2 4 2019-10-30 TRUE -20037.

Independently testing these reports is one of the strongest forms of assurance, which requires an understanding of the underlying data, including calculation accuracy and completeness. At its core, an aging calculation is the comparison of one date to another certain date, and then aggregating the total amount by buckets indicating a range of days. However, it gets complicated rather quick because of how different systems implement aging: Which dates are being compared - invoice dates, entry dates, paid dates and/or due dates? Speaking of due dates, are you able to calculate a due date on a per-vendor (or even, per invoice) basis? Are you able to run a report ‘as-of’? The as-of date is intended to help understand the outstanding balances at a specific point of time. Some accounting systems have insufficient information captured, meaning a backdated entered invoice (perhaps to a prior period) may affect the accuracy of a previous report. We will initially filter our data and only keep valid invoices, by filtering on records that are related to materials: gl %&gt;% filter(account == &#39;exp_materials_6000&#39;) %&gt;% # In scope invoices for aging select(je_num, vendor_id, gl_date, invoice_date, paid_date) ## # A tibble: 952 x 5 ## je_num vendor_id gl_date invoice_date paid_date ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;date&gt; &lt;date&gt; &lt;date&gt; ## 1 1 2211 2019-12-02 2019-11-25 2020-01-01 ## 2 2 2612 2019-11-28 2019-11-18 2019-12-21 ## 3 3 2612 2019-04-09 2019-03-30 2019-05-02 ## 4 4 2612 2019-10-30 2019-10-20 2019-11-22 ## 5 5 2612 2019-06-04 2019-05-25 2019-06-27 ## 6 6 2726 2019-01-31 2019-01-24 2019-02-03 ## 7 7 2726 2019-10-21 2019-10-14 2019-10-24 ## 8 8 2211 2019-04-24 2019-04-17 2019-05-24 ## 9 9 2726 2019-07-10 2019-07-03 2019-07-13 ## 10 10 2211 2019-06-13 2019-06-06 2019-07-13 ## # … with 942 more rows In our GL data set, we have captured invoices (denoted as transactions against expense accounts), as well as the GL date (the day the company received the invoice), the invoice date as written by the supplier, and the date the invoice was paid.

The labels look a bit different - inclusive boundaries are ( while exclusive boundaries are ], but either of these can be used: aged_wip %&gt;% mutate(aging_bucket = cut(aged_wip$aged_days, breaks = c(0, 15, 30, 60, Inf))) ## # A tibble: 71 x 2 ## aged_days aging_bucket ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt; ## 1 12 (0,15] ## 2 19 (15,30] ## 3 16 (15,30] ## 4 24 (15,30] ## 5 14 (0,15] ## 6 27 (15,30] ## 7 31 (30,60] ## 8 27 (15,30] ## 9 11 (0,15] ## 10 12 (0,15] ## # … with 61 more rows With all the pieces, we can now create the aging report, aggregated by vendor.

ACL Analytics itself is strongly tied into the Galvanize Highbond cloud software, and development efforts can be done locally prior to uploading into their Robotics tool. R is useful as your team reaches a higher level of maturity due to its ability to incorporate version control, markdown reports and code packages. The ceiling and technical capabilities required are higher, especially as you move into command prompt oriented software. Inexperienced teams are encouraged to develop their best audit foundation practices, as it is less about the tool and more about the aptitude. As your team reaches the ceiling of your current toolset and maturity level, then it is worth considering adding to your toolkit. There are several similarities and differences to help bridge the gap when transferring between the tools, and this appendix will help you bridge the gap. 13.1 Import 13.2 Data 13.2.1 Joins The join command is similar, but there are some syntax and behaviours differences you need to be aware of: ACL AN R (tidyverse) Difference JOIN with no keywords inner_join(...)

AN will return the first match found in the Primary table per row. PKEY &lt;pkey1&gt; SKEY &lt;skey1&gt; *_join(..., by = c('pkey1' = 'skey1', 'pkey2' = 'skey2')) Join key goes into the by command. Additional join keys can be added. FIELDS ALL semi_join(...) Filters the Primary table, only keeping matches that existed in the Secondary table FIELDS &lt;names&gt; WITH &lt;names&gt; All columns from both tables are kept by design. &lt;names&gt; of columns can not be specified, and need to be pre-selected beforehand PRIMARY left_join(...) Unmatched keys will have secondary column values written as NA SECONDARY right_join(...) Unmatched keys will have primary column values be written as NA PRIMARY SECONDARY full_join(...) Unmatched keys will have primary or secondary column values written as NA UNMATCHED anti_join(...) 13.3 Analyze "],
